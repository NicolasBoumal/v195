title: 'Utilising the CLT Structure in Stochastic Gradient based Sampling : Improved
  Analysis and Faster Algorithms'
abstract: We consider stochastic approximations of sampling algorithms, such as Stochastic
  Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and the Random Batch Method (RBM) for Interacting
  Particle Dynamcs (IPD). We observe that the noise introduced by the stochastic approximation
  is nearly Gaussian due to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) while the driving Brownian
  motion is exactly Gaussian. We harness this structure to absorb the stochastic approximation
  error inside the diffusion process, and obtain improved convergence guarantees for
  these algorithms. For SGLD, we prove the first stable convergence rate in KL divergence
  without requiring uniform warm start, assuming the target density satisfies a Log-Sobolev
  Inequality. Our result implies superior first-order oracle complexity compared to
  prior works, under significantly milder assumptions. We also prove the first guarantees
  for SGLD under even weaker conditions such as HÃ¶lder smoothness and Poincare Inequality,
  thus bridging the gap between the state-of-the-art guarantees for LMC and SGLD.
  Our analysis motivates a new algorithm called covariance correction, which corrects
  for the additional noise introduced by the stochastic approximation by rescaling
  the strength of the diffusion. Finally, we apply our techniques to analyze RBM,
  and significantly improve upon the guarantees in prior works (such as removing exponential
  dependence on horizon), under minimal assumptions.
