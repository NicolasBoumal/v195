title: 'Empirical Bayes via ERM and Rademacher complexities: the Poisson model'
abstract: 'We consider the problem of empirical Bayes estimation for (multivariate)
  Poisson means. Existing solutions that have been shown theoretically optimal for
  minimizing the regret (excess risk over the Bayesian oracle that knows the prior)
  have several shortcomings. For example, the classical Robbins estimator does not
  retain the monotonicity property of the Bayes estimator and performs poorly under
  moderate sample size. Estimators based on the minimum distance and non-parametric
  maximum likelihood (NPMLE) methods correct these issues, but are computationally
  expensive with complexity growing exponentially with dimension. Extending the approach
  of Barbehenn andZhao (2022), in this work we construct monotone estimators based
  on empirical risk minimization (ERM) that retain similar theoretical guarantees
  and can be computed much more efficiently. Adapting the idea of offset Rademacher
  complexity Liang et al. (2015) to the non-standard loss and function class in empirical
  Bayes, we show that the shape-constrained ERM estimator attains the minimax regret
  within constant factors in one dimension and within logarithmic factors in multiple
  dimensions. '
