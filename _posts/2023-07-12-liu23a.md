title: Improved Bounds for Multi-task Learning with Trace Norm Regularization
abstract: 'Compared with learning each task independently, multi-task learning (MTL)
  is able to learn with few training samples and achieves better prediction performance.
  Recently, Boursier et al. (2022) study the estimation error bound for MTL with trace
  norm regularizer and a few observations per task. However, their results rely on
  three assumptions: 1) The features are isotropic; 2) The task diversity assumption
  is enforced to the parameters matrix; 3) The number of tasks is larger than the
  features dimension. Whether it is possible to drop these three assumptions and improve
  the bounds in Boursier et al. (2022) has remained unknown. This paper provides an
  affirmative answer to this question. Specifically, we reduce their upper bounds
  from $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sigma \sqrt{\frac{rd^2/m+rT}{m}} + \sqrt{\frac{rd^2/m+rdT/m}{m}})$
  to $\mathcal{O}( \sigma\sqrt{\frac{r+rd/T}{m}} )$ without three assumptions, where
  $T$ is the number of tasks, $d$ is the dimension of the feature space, $m$ is the
  number of observations per task, $r$ is the rank of ground truth matrix, $\sigma$
  is the standard deviation of the noise random variable. Moreover, we provide minimax
  lower bounds showing our upper bounds are rateoptimal if $T =\mathcal{O}(d)$.'
