title: 'Backward Feature Correction: How Deep Learning Performs Deep (Hierarchical)
  Learning'
abstract: Deep learning is also known as hierarchical learning, where the learner
  $\textit{learns}$ to represent a complicated target function by decomposing it into
  a sequence of simpler functions  to reduce sample and time complexity. This paper
  formally analyzes how multi-layer neural networks can perform such hierarchical
  learning $\textit{efficiently}$ and $\textit{automatically}$ by applying stochastic
  gradient descent (SGD) or its variants on the training objective.On the conceptual
  side, we present a theoretical characterizations of how certain types of deep (i.e.
  super-constantly many layers) neural networks can still be sample and time efficiently
  trained on some hierarchical learning tasks, when no known existing algorithm (including
  layerwise training, kernel method, etc) is efficient. We establish a new principle
  called “backward feature correction”, where \emph{the errors in the lower-level
  features can be automatically corrected when training together with the higher-level
  layers}. We believe this is a key behind how deep learning is performing deep (hierarchical)
  learning, as opposed to layerwise learning or simulating some known non-hierarchical
  method.
