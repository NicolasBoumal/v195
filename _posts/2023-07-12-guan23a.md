title: Online Nonconvex Optimization with Limited Instantaneous Oracle Feedback
abstract: 'We investigate online nonconvex optimization from a local regret minimization
  perspective. Previous studies along this line implicitly required the access to
  sufficient gradient oracles at each time instance in order to design double-loop
  algorithms. In this work, we focus on more challenging but practical settings where
  only limited number of oracles are available in online nonconvex optimization, including
  window-smoothed single gradient oracle (Window-SGO), single function value oracle
  (Window-SVO) and multiple function value oracles (Window-MVO). Specifically, in
  the Window-SGO setting which allows only single-loop algorithm design, we derive
  a local regret lower bound, which indicates that single-loop algorithms are provably
  worse than double-loop algorithms. Further, the simple classical OGD algorithm achieves
  the window-unconditioned lower bound. Moreover, in the Window-SVO setting, we propose
  a novel single-loop online algorithm named SkipOGD, and show that it achieves a
  near-optimal local regret that matches the Window-SGO regret lower bound up to a
  factor of the dimension $d$ due to the function value feedback. Lastly, in the Window-MVO
  setting, we propose a new double-loop online algorithm named LoopOGD and show that
  it achieves a smooth trade-off between regret minimization and sample complexity
  over the number of oracle calls $K$ per time instance. In particular, with $K=1$
  and $wd$, LoopOGD respectively achieves our regret lower bound with Window-SGO (up
  to the factor $d$ due to function value feedback) and the existing regret lower
  bound with multiple gradient oracle feedback. '
