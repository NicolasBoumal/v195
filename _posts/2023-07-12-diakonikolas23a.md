title: Information-Computation Tradeoffs for Learning Margin Halfspaces with Random
  Classification Noise
abstract: We study the problem of PAC learning $\gamma$-margin halfspaces with Random
  Classification Noise. We establish an information-computation tradeoffsuggesting
  an inherent gap between the sample complexity of the problem and the sample complexity
  of computationally efficient algorithms. Concretely, the sample complexity of the
  problem is $\widetilde{\Theta}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon))$. We start by giving a simple
  efficient algorithm with sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon^2))$.
  Our main resultis a lower bound for Statistical Query (SQ) algorithms and low-degree
  polynomial tests suggesting that the quadratic dependence on $1/\epsilon$ in the
  sample complexity is inherent for computationally efficient algorithms.Specifically,
  our results imply a lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(1/(\gamma^{1/2} \epsilon^2))$
  on the sample complexity of any efficient SQ learner or low-degree test.
