title: A Nearly Tight Bound for Fitting an Ellipsoid to Gaussian Random Points
abstract: We prove that for $c>0$ a sufficiently small universal constant that a random
  set of $c d^2/\log^4(d)$ independent Gaussian random points in $\R^d$ lie on a common
  ellipsoid with high probability. This nearly establishes a conjecture ofÂ \citet{SaundersonCPW12},
  within logarithmic factors.The latter conjecture has attracted significant attention
  over the past decade, dueto its connections to machine learning and sum-of-squares
  lower bounds for certain statistical problems.
