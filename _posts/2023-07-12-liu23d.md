title: Asymptotic confidence sets for random linear programs
abstract: Motivated by the statistical analysis of the discrete optimal transport
  problem, we prove distributional limits for the solutions of linear programs with
  random constraints.Such limits were first obtained by Klatt, Munk, & Zemel (2022),
  but their expressions for the limits involve a computationally intractable decomposition
  of $\mathbb{R}^m$ into a possibly exponential number of convex cones.We give a new
  expression for the limit in terms of auxiliary linear programs, which can be solved
  in polynomial time.We also leverage tools from random convex geometry to give distributional
  limits for the entire set of random optimal solutions, when the optimum is not unique.Finally,
  we describe a simple, data-driven method to construct asymptotically valid confidence
  sets in polynomial time.
