title: Online Learning in Dynamically Changing Environments
abstract: We study the problem of online learning and online regret minimization when
  samples are drawn from a general unknown \emph{non-stationary} process. We introduce
  the concept of a \emph{dynamic changing process} with cost $K$, where the \emph{conditional}
  marginals of the process can vary arbitrarily, but that the number of different
  conditional marginals is bounded by $K$ over $T$ rounds. For such processes we prove
  a tight (upto $\sqrt{\log T}$ factor) bound $O(\sqrt{KT\cdot\vch\log T})$ for the
  \emph{expected worst case} regret of any finite VC-dimensional class $\mathcal{H}$
  under absolute loss (i.e., the expected miss-classification loss). We then improve
  this bound for general mixable losses, by establishing a tight (up to $\log^3 T$
  factor) regret bound $O(K\cdot\vch\log^3 T)$. We extend these results to general
  \emph{smooth adversary} processes with \emph{unknown} reference measure by showing
  a sub-linear regret bound for $1$-dimensional threshold functions under a general
  bounded convex loss. Our results can be viewed as a first step towards regret analysis
  with non-stationary samples in the \emph{distribution blind} (universal) regime.
  This also brings a new viewpoint that shifts the study of complexity of the hypothesis
  classes to the study of the complexity of processes generating data.
