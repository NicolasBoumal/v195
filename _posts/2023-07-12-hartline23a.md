title: Optimal Scoring Rules for Multi-dimensional Effort
abstract: This paper develops a framework for the design of scoring rules to optimally
  incentivize an agent to exert a multi-dimensional effort. This framework is a generalization
  to strategic agents of the classical knapsack problem (cf. Briest, Krysta, and Vocking,
  2005; Singer, 2010) and it is foundational to applying algorithmic mechanism design
  to the classroom. The paper identifies two simple families of scoring rules that
  guarantee constant approximations to the optimal scoring rule. The truncated separate
  scoring rule is the sum of single dimensional scoring rules that is truncated to
  the bounded range of feasible scores. The threshold scoring rule gives the maximum
  score if reports exceed a threshold and zero otherwise. Approximate optimality of
  one or the other of these rules is similar to the bundling or selling separately
  result of Babaioff, Immorlica, Lucier, and Weinberg (2014). Finally, we show that
  the approximate optimality of the best of those two simple scoring rules is robust
  when the agentâ€™s choice of effort is made sequentially.
