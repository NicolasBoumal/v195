title: Tight Guarantees for Interactive Decision Making with the Decision-Estimation
  Coefficient
abstract: A foundational problem in reinforcement learning and interactive decision
  making is to understand what modeling assumptions lead to sample-efficient learning
  guarantees, and what algorithm design principles achieve optimal sample complexity.
  Recently, Foster et al. (2021) introduced the Decision- Estimation Coefficient (DEC),
  a measure of statistical complexity which leads to upper and lower bounds on the
  optimal sample complexity for a general class of problems encompassing bandits and
  reinforcement learning with function approximation. In this paper, we introduce
  a new variant of the DEC, the Constrained Decision-Estimation Coefficient, and use
  it to derive new lower bounds that improve upon prior work on three fronts:• they
  hold in expectation, with no restrictions on the class of algorithms under consideration.•
  they hold globally, and do not rely on the notion of localization used by Foster
  et al. (2021).• most interestingly, they allow the reference model with respect
  to which the DEC is defined to be improper, establishing that improper reference
  models play a fundamental role.We provide upper bounds on regret that scale with
  the same quantity, thereby closing all but one of the gaps between upper and lower
  bounds in Foster et al. (2021). Our results apply to both the regret framework and
  PAC framework, and make use of several new analysis and algorithm design techniques
  that we anticipate will find broader use.
