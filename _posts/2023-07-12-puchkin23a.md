title: Exploring Local Norms in Exp-concave Statistical Learning
abstract: We consider the standard problem of stochastic convex optimization with
  exp-concave losses using Empirical Risk Minimization in a convex class. Answering
  a question raised in several prior works, we provide a $O ( d/n + 1/n \log( 1 /
  \delta ) )$ excess risk bound valid for a wide class of bounded exp-concave losses,
  where $d$ is the dimension of the convex reference set, $n$ is the sample size,
  and $\delta$ is the confidence level. Our result is based on a unified geometric
  assumption on the gradient of losses and the notion of local norms.
