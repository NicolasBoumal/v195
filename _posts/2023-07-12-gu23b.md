title: Weak Recovery Threshold for the Hypergraph Stochastic Block Model
abstract: We study the weak recovery problem on the $r$-uniform hypergraph stochastic
  block model ($r$-HSBM) with two balanced communities. In HSBM a random graph is
  constructed by placing hyperedges with higher density if all vertices of a hyperedge
  share the same binary label, and weak recovery asks to recover a non-trivial fraction
  of the labels. We introduce a multi-terminal version of strong data processing inequalities
  (SDPIs), which we call the multi-terminal SDPI, and use it to prove a variety of
  impossibility results for weak recovery. In particular, we prove that weak recovery
  is impossible below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold if $r=3,4$, or a strength parameter
  $\lambda$ is at least $\frac 15$. Prior work Pal and Zhu (2021) established that
  weak recovery in HSBM is always possible above the KS threshold. Consequently, there
  is no information-computation gap for these cases, which (partially) resolves a
  conjecture of Angelini et al. (2015). To our knowledge this is the first impossibility
  result for HSBM weak recovery.As usual, we reduce the study of non-recovery of HSBM
  to the study of non-reconstruction in a related broadcasting on hypertrees (BOHT)
  model. While we show that BOHTâ€™s reconstruction threshold coincides with KS for
  $r=3,4$, surprisingly, we demonstrate that for $r\ge 7$ reconstruction is possible
  also below KS. This shows an interesting phase transition in the parameter $r$,
  and suggests that for $r\ge 7$, there might be an information-computation gap for
  the HSBM. For $r=5,6$ and large degree we propose an approach for showing non-reconstruction
  below KS, suggesting that $r=7$ is the correct threshold for onset of the new phase.
