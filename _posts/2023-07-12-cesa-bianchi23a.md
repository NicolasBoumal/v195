title: Repeated Bilateral Trade Against a Smoothed Adversary
abstract: We study repeated bilateral trade where an adaptive $\sigma$-smooth adversary
  generates the valuations of sellers and buyers. We provide a complete characterization
  of the regret regimes for fixed-price mechanisms under different feedback models
  in the two cases where the learner can post either the same or different prices
  to buyers and sellers.We begin by showing that the minimax regret after $T$ rounds
  is of order $\sqrt{T}$ in the full-feedback scenario. Under partial feedback, any
  algorithm that has to post the same price to buyers and sellers suffers worst-case
  linear regret. However, when the learner can post two different prices at each round,
  we design an algorithm enjoying regret of order $T^{3/4}$ ignoring log factors.We
  prove that this rate is optimal by presenting a surprising $T^{3/4}$ lower bound,
  which is the main technical contribution of the paper.
