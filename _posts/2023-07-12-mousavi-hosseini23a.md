title: 'Towards a Complete Analysis of Langevin Monte Carlo: Beyond Poincaré Inequality'
abstract: Langevin diffusions are rapidly convergent under appropriate functional
  inequality assumptions. Hence, it is natural to expect that with additional smoothness
  conditions to handle the discretization errors, their discretizations like the Langevin
  Monte Carlo (LMC) converge in a similar fashion. This research program was initiated
  by Vempala and Wibisono (2019), who established results under log-Sobolev inequalities.
  Chewi et al. (2022a) extended the results to handle the case of Poincaré inequalities.
  In this paper, we go beyond Poincaré inequalities, and push this research program
  to its limit. We do so by establishing upper and lower bounds for Langevin diffusions
  and LMC under weak Poincaré inequalities that are satisfied by a large class of
  densities including polynomially-decaying heavy-tailed densities (i.e., Cauchy-type).
  Our results explicitly quantify the effect of the initializer on the performance
  of the LMC algorithm. In particular, we show that as the tail goes from sub-Gaussian,
  to sub-exponential, and finally to Cauchy-like, the dependency on the initial error
  goes from being logarithmic, to polynomial, and then finally to being exponential.
  This three-step phase transition is in particular unavoidable as demonstrated by
  our lower bounds, clearly defining the boundaries of LMC.
