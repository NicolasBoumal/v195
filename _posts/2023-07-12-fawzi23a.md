title: Quantum Channel Certification with Incoherent Measurements
abstract: In the problem of quantum channel certification, we have black box access
  to a quantum process and would like to decide if this process matches some predefined
  specification or is $\eps$-far from this specification. The objective is to achieve
  this task while minimizing the number of times the black box is used. Note that
  the state certification problem is a special case where the black box has no input.
  Here, we focus on two relevant extreme cases. The first one is when the predefined
  specification is a unitary channel, e.g., a gate in a quantum circuit.  In this
  case, we show that testing whether the black box is described by a fixed unitary
  or $\eps$-far from it in the trace norm requires $\Theta(d/\eps^2)$ uses of the
  black box. The second setting we consider is when the predefined specification is
  a completely depolarizing channels with input dimension $\din$ and output dimension
  $\dout$. In this case, we prove that, in the non-adaptive setting, $\Tilde{\Theta}(\din^2\dout^{1.5}/\eps^2)$
  uses of the channel are necessary and sufficient to verify whether it is equal to
  the depolarizing channel or $\eps$-far from it in the diamond norm. Finally, we
  prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\din^2\dout/\eps^2)$ for this problem in the adaptive
  setting. Note that the special case $\din = 1$ corresponds to the well-studied quantum
  identity testing problem.
