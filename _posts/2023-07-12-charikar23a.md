title: Fast Algorithms for a New Relaxation of Optimal Transport
abstract: We introduce a new class of objectives for optimal transport computations
  of datasets in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The new objectives are parametrized
  by $\rho \geq 1$, and provide a metric space $\mathcal{R}_{\rho}(\cdot, \cdot)$
  for discrete probability distributions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. As $\rho$ approaches $1$,
  the metric approaches the Earth Mover’s distance, but for $\rho$ larger than (but
  close to) $1$, admits significantly faster algorithms. Namely, for distributions
  $\mu$ and $\nu$ supported on $n$ and $m$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ of norm at most
  $r$ and any $\epsilon > 0$, we give an algorithm which outputs an additive $\epsilon
  r$ approximation to $\mathcal{R}_{\rho}(\mu, \nu)$ in time $(n+m) \cdot \mathrm{poly}((nm)^{(\rho-1)/\rho}
  \cdot 2^{\rho / (\rho-1)} / \epsilon)$.
