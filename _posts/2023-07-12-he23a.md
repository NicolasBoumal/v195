title: Algorithmically Effective Differentially Private Synthetic Data
abstract: We present a highly effective algorithmic approach for generating $\varepsilon$-differentially
  private synthetic data in a bounded metric space with near-optimal utility guarantees
  under the  1-Wasserstein distance. In particular, for a dataset $\mathcal X$ in
  the hypercube $[0,1]^d$, our algorithm generates synthetic dataset $\mathcal Y$
  such that the expected 1-Wasserstein distance between the empirical measure of $\mathcal
  X$ and $\mathcal Y$ is $O((\varepsilon n)^{-1/d})$ for $d\geq 2$, and is $O(\log^2(\varepsilon
  n)(\varepsilon n)^{-1})$ for $d=1$. The accuracy guarantee is optimal up to a constant
  factor for $d\geq 2$, and up to a logarithmic factor for $d=1$. Our algorithm has
  a fast running time of $O(\varepsilon d n)$ for all $d\geq 1$ and demonstrates improved
  accuracy compared to the method in Boedihardjo et al. (2022) for $d\geq 2$.
