title: On Testing and Learning Quantum Junta Channels
abstract: We consider the problems of testing and learning quantum k-junta channels,
  which are n-qubit to n-qubit quantum channels acting non-trivially on at most k
  out of n qubits and leaving the rest of qubits unchanged. We show the following.1.
  An \tilde{O}(k)-query algorithm to distinguish whether the given channel is k-junta
  channel or is far from any k-junta channels, and a lower bound \Omega(\sqrt{k})
  on the number of queries;2. An \tilde{O}(4^k)-query algorithm to learn a k-junta
  channel, and a lower bound \Omega(4^k/k) on the number of queries.This gives the
  first junta channel testing and learning results, and partially answers an open
  problem raised by Chen et al. (2023). In order to settle these problems, we develop
  a Fourier analysis framework over the space of superoperators and prove several
  fundamental properties, which extends the Fourier analysis over the space of operators
  introduced in Montanaro and Osborne (2010).
