title: Information-Directed Selection for Top-Two Algorithms
abstract: We consider the best-k-arm identification problem for multi-armed bandits,
  where the objective is to select the exact set of k arms with the highest mean rewards
  by sequentially allocating measurement effort. We characterize the necessary and
  sufficient conditions for the optimal allocation using dual variables. Remarkably
  these optimality conditions lead to the extension of top-two algorithm design principle
  (Russo, 2020), initially proposed for best-arm identification. Furthermore, our
  optimality conditions induce a simple and effective selection rule dubbed information-directed
  selection (IDS) that selects one of the top-two candidates based on a measure of
  information gain. As a theoretical guarantee, we prove that integrated with IDS,
  top-two Thompson sampling is (asymptotically) optimal for Gaussian best-arm identification,
  solving a glaring open problem in the pure exploration literature (Russo, 2020).
  As a by-product, we show that for $k > 1$, top-two algorithms cannot achieve optimality
  even with an oracle tuning parameter. Numerical experiments show the superior performance
  of the proposed top-two algorithms with IDS and considerable improvement compared
  with algorithms without adaptive selection.
