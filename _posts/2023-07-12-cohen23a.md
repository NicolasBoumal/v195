title: Local Glivenko-Cantelli
abstract: 'If $\mu$ is a distribution over the $d$-dimensional Boolean cube $\set{0,1}^d$,
  our goal is to estimate its mean $p\in[0,1]^d$ based on $n$ iid draws from $\mu$.
  Specifically, we consider the empirical mean estimator $\pn$ and study the expected
  maximal deviation $\Delta_n=\E\max_{j\in[d]}|\pn(j)-p(j)|$. In the classical Universal
  Glivenko-Cantelli setting, one seeks distribution-free (i.e., independent of $\mu$)
  bounds on $\Delta_n$. This regime is well-understood: for all $\mu$, we have $\Delta_n\lesssim\sqrt{\log(d)/n}$
  up to universal constants, and the bound is tight.Our present work seeks to establish
  dimension-free (i.e., without an explicit dependence on $d$) estimates on $\Delta_n$,
  including those that hold for $d=\infty$. As such bounds must necessarily depend
  on $\mu$, we refer to this regime as {\em local} Glivenko-Cantelli (also known as
  $\mu$-GC), and are aware of very few previous bounds of this type — which are either
  “abstract” or quite sub-optimal. Already the special case of product measures $\mu$
  is rather non-trivial. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on $\mu$ for
  $\Delta_n\to0$, and calculate sharp rates for this decay. Along the way, we discover
  a novel sub-gamma-type maximal inequality for shifted Bernoullis, of independent
  interest.'
