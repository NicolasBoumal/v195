title: Efficient median of means estimator
abstract: The goal of this note is to present a modification of the popular median
  of means estimator that achieves sub-Gaussian deviation bounds with nearly optimal
  constants under minimal assumptions on the underlying distribution. We build on
  a recent work on the topic and prove that desired guarantees can be attained under
  weaker requirements.
