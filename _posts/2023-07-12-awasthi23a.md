title: 'Open Problem: The Sample Complexity of Multi-Distribution Learning for VC
  Classes'
abstract: Multi-distribution learning is a natural generalization of PAC learning
  to settings with multiple data distributions. There remains a significant gap between
  the known upper and lower bounds for PAC-learnable classes. In particular, though
  we understand the sample complexity of learning a VC dimension $d$ class on $k$
  distributions to be $O(\epsilon^{-2} \ln(k) (d + k) + \min \{\epsilon^{-1} d k,  \epsilon^{-4}
  \ln(k) d\})$, the best lower bound is $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}(d + k \ln(k)))$. We
  discuss recent progress on this problem and some hurdles that are fundamental to
  the use of game dynamics in statistical learning.
