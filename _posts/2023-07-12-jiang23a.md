title: 'Online Learning Guided Curvature Approximation: A Quasi-Newton Method with
  Global Non-Asymptotic Superlinear Convergence'
abstract: Quasi-Newton algorithms are among the most popular iterative methods for
  solving unconstrained minimization problems, largely due to their favorable superlinear
  convergence property. However, existing results for these algorithms are limited
  as they provide either (i) a global convergence guarantee with an asymptotic superlinear
  convergence rate, or (ii) a local non-asymptotic superlinear rate for the case that
  the initial point and the initial Hessian approximation are chosen properly. In
  particular, no current analysis for quasi-Newton methods guarantees global convergence
  with an explicit superlinear convergence rate. In this paper, we close this gap
  and present  the first globally convergent quasi-Newton method with an explicit
  non-asymptotic superlinear convergence rate. Unlike classical quasi-Newton methods,
  we build our algorithm upon the hybrid proximal extragradient method and propose
  a novel online learning framework for updating the Hessian approximation matrices.
  Specifically, guided by the convergence analysis, we formulate the Hessian approximation
  update as an online convex optimization problem in the space of matrices, and we
  relate the bounded regret of the online problem to the superlinear convergence of
  our method.
