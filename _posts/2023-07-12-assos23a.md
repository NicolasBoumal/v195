title: Online Learning and Solving Infinite Games with an ERM Oracle
abstract: While ERM suffices to attain near-optimal generalization error in the stochastic
  learning setting, this is not known to be the case in the online learning setting,
  where algorithms for general concept classes rely on computationally inefficient
  oracles such as the Standard Optimal Algorithm (SOA). In this work, we propose an
  algorithm for  online binary classification setting that relies solely on ERM oracle
  calls, and show that it has finite regret in the realizable setting and sublinearly
  growing regret in the agnostic setting. We bound the regret in terms of the Littlestone
  and threshold dimensions of the underlying concept class.We obtain similar results
  for nonparametric games, where the ERM oracle can be interpreted as a best response
  oracle, finding the best response of a player to a given history of play of the
  other players. In this setting, we provide learning algorithms that only rely on
  best response oracles and converge to approximate-minimax equilibria in  two-player
  zero-sum games and  approximate coarse correlated equilibria in multi-player general-sum
  games, as long as the game has bounded fat-threshold dimension. Our algorithms apply
  to both binary-valued and real-valued games and can be viewed as providing justification
  for the wide use of double oracle and multiple oracle algorithms in the practice
  of solving large games.
