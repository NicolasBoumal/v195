title: Generalization Guarantees via Algorithm-dependent Rademacher Complexity
abstract: Algorithm- and data-dependent generalization bounds are required to explain
  the generalization behavior of modern machine learning algorithms. In this context,
  there exists information theoretic generalization bounds that involve (various forms
  of) mutual information, as well as bounds based on hypothesis set stability. We
  propose a conceptually related, but technically distinct complexity measure to control
  generalization error, which is the empirical Rademacher complexity of an algorithm-
  and data-dependent hypothesis class. Combining standard properties of Rademacher
  complexity with the convenient structure of this class, we are able to (i) obtain
  novel bounds based on the finite fractal dimension, which (a) extend previous fractal
  dimension-type bounds from continuous to finite hypothesis classes, and (b) avoid
  a mutual information term that was required in prior work; (ii) we greatly simplify
  the proof of a recent dimension-independent generalization bound for stochastic
  gradient descent; and (iii) we easily recover results for VC classes and compression
  schemes, similar to approaches based on conditional mutual information.
