title: Minimizing Dynamic Regret on Geodesic Metric Spaces
abstract: In this paper, we consider the sequential decision problem where the goal
  is to minimize the general dynamic regret on a complete Riemannian manifold. The
  task of offline optimization on such a domain, also known as a geodesic metric space,
  has recently received significant attention. The online setting has received significantly
  less attention, and it has remained an open question whether the body of results
  that hold in the Euclidean setting can be transplanted into the land of Riemannian
  manifolds where new challenges (e.g., curvature) come into play. In this paper,
  we show how to get optimistic regret bound on manifolds with non-positive curvature
  whenever improper learning is allowed and propose an array of adaptive no-regret
  algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers
  general dynamic regret and develops “optimistic” online learning algorithms which
  can be employed on geodesic metric spaces.
