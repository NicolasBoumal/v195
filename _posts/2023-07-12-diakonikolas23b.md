title: SQ Lower Bounds for Learning Mixtures of Separated and Bounded Covariance Gaussians
abstract: 'We study the complexity of learning mixtures of separated Gaussians with
  common unknown bounded covariance matrix. Specifically, we focus on learning Gaussian
  mixture models (GMMs) on $\mathbb{R}^d$ of the form $P= \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \mathcal{N}(\vec
  \mu_i,\vec \Sigma_i)$, where $\vec \Sigma_i = \vec \Sigma \preceq \vec I$and $\min_{i
  \neq j} \|\vec \mu_i - \vec \mu_j\|_2 \geq k^\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon>0$. Known
  learning algorithms for this family of GMMs have complexity $(dk)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$.
  In this work, we prove that any Statistical Query (SQ) algorithm for this problem
  requires complexity at least  $d^{\Omega(1/\epsilon)}$. Our SQ lower bound implies
  a similar lower bound for low-degree polynomial tests. Our result provides evidence
  that known algorithms for this problem are nearly best possible. '
