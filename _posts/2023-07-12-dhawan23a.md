title: Sharp analysis of EM for learning mixtures of pairwise differences
abstract: We consider a symmetric mixture of linear regressions with random samples
  from the pairwise comparison design, which can be seen as a noisy version of a type
  of Euclidean distance geometry problem. We analyze the expectation-maximization
  (EM) algorithm locally around the ground truth and establish that the sequence converges
  linearly, providing an $\ell_\infty$-norm guarantee on the estimation error of the
  iterates. Furthermore, we show that the limit of the EM sequence achieves the sharp
  rate of estimation in the $\ell_2$-norm, matching the information-theoretically
  optimal constant. We also argue through simulation that convergence from a random
  initialization is much more delicate in this setting, and does not appear to occur
  in general. Our results show that the EM algorithm can exhibit several unique behaviors
  when the covariate distribution is suitably structured.
