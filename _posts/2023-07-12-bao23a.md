title: Proper Losses, Moduli of Convexity, and Surrogate Regret Bounds
abstract: 'Proper losses (or proper scoring rules) have been used for over half a
  century to elicit usersâ€™ subjective probability from the observations. In the recent
  machine learning community, we often tackle downstream tasks such as classification
  and bipartite ranking with the elicited probabilities. Here, we engage in assessing
  the quality of the elicited probabilities with different proper losses, which can
  be characterized by surrogate regret bounds to describe the convergence speed of
  an estimated probability to the optimal one when optimizing a proper loss. This
  work contributes to a sharp analysis of surrogate regret bounds in two ways. First,
  we provide general surrogate regret bounds for proper losses measured by the $L^1$
  distance. This abstraction eschews a tailor-made analysis of each downstream task
  and delineates how universally a loss function operates. Our analysis relies on
  a classical mathematical tool known as the moduli of convexity, which is of independent
  interest per se. Second, we evaluate the surrogate regret bounds with polynomials
  to identify the quantitative convergence rate. These devices enable us to compare
  different losses, with which we can confirm that the lower bound of the surrogate
  regret bounds is $\Omega(\epsilon^{1/2})$ for popular loss functions. '
