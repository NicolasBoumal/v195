title: 'Private Online Prediction from Experts:  Separations and Faster Rates'
abstract: Online prediction from experts is a fundamental problem in machine learning
  and several works have studied this problem under privacy constraints. We propose
  and analyze new algorithms for this problem that improve over the regret bounds
  of the best existing algorithms for non-adaptive adversaries. For approximate differential
  privacy, our algorithms achieve regret bounds of $\wt O(\sqrt{T \log d} + \log d/\eps)$
  for the stochastic setting and $\wt O(\sqrt{T \log d} + T^{1/3} \log d/\eps)$ for
  oblivious adversaries (where $d$ is the number of experts). For pure DP, our algorithms
  are the first to obtain sub-linear regret for oblivious adversaries in the high-dimensional
  regime $d \ge T$. Moreover, we prove new lower bounds for adaptive adversaries.
  Our results imply that unlike the non-private setting, there is a strong separation
  between the optimal regret for adaptive and non-adaptive adversaries for this problem.
  Our lower bounds also show a separation between pure and approximate differential
  privacy for adaptive adversaries where the latter is necessary to achieve the non-private
  $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret.
