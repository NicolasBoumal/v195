title: Best-of-Three-Worlds Linear Bandit Algorithm with Variance-Adaptive Regret
  Bounds
abstract: This paper proposes a linear bandit algorithm that is adaptive to environments
  at two different levels of hierarchy.  At the higher level, the proposed algorithm
  adapts to a variety of types of environments.  More precisely, it achieves best-of-three-worlds
  regret bounds, i.e., of ${O}(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for adversarial environments and
  of $O(\frac{\log T}{\Delta_{\min}} + \sqrt{\frac{C \log T}{\Delta_{\min}}})$ for
  stochastic environments with adversarial corruptions, where $T$, $\Delta_{\min}$,
  and $C$ denote, respectively, the time horizon, the minimum sub-optimality gap,
  and the total amount of the corruption.  Note that polynomial factors in the dimensionality
  are omitted here.  At the lower level, in each of the adversarial and stochastic
  regimes, the proposed algorithm adapts to certain environmental characteristics,
  thereby performing better.  The proposed algorithm has data-dependent regret bounds
  that depend on all of the cumulative loss for the optimal action, the total quadratic
  variation, and the path-length of the loss vector sequence.  In addition, for stochastic
  environments, the proposed algorithm has a variance-adaptive regret bound of $O(\frac{\sigma^2
  \log T}{\Delta_{\min}})$ as well, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the maximum variance
  of the feedback loss.  The proposed algorithm is based on the \texttt{SCRiBLe} algorithm
  (Abernethy et al., 2012).  By incorporating into this a new technique we call \textit{scaled-up
  sampling}, we obtain high-level adaptability, and by incorporating the technique
  of optimistic online learning, we obtain low-level adaptability.
