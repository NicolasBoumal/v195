title: 'STay-ON-the-Ridge: Guaranteed Convergence to Local Minimax Equilibrium in
  Nonconvex-Nonconcave Games'
abstract: "   Min-max optimization problems involving nonconvex-nonconcave objectives
  have found important applications in adversarial training and other multi-agent
  learning settings. Yet, no known gradient descent-based method is guaranteed to
  converge to (even local notions of) min-max equilibrium in the nonconvex-nonconcave
  setting. For all known methods, there exist relatively simple objectives for which
  they cycle or exhibit other undesirable behavior different from converging to a
  point,  let alone to some game-theoretically meaningful one \\citep{flokas2019poincare,hsieh2021limits}.
  The only known convergence guarantees hold under the strong assumption that the
  initialization is very close to a local min-max equilibrium \\citep{wang2019solving}.
  Moreover, the afore-described challenges are not just theoretical curiosities. All
  known methods are  unstable  in  practice, even in simple settings.We propose the
  first method that is guaranteed to converge to a local min-max equilibrium for smooth
  nonconvex-nonconcave objectives. Our method is second-order and provably escapes
  limit cycles as long as it is initialized at an easy-to-find initial point. Both
  the definition of our method and its convergence analysis are motivated by the topological
  nature of the problem. In particular, our method is not designed to decrease some
  potential function, such as the distance of its iterate from the set of local min-max
  equilibria or the projected gradient of the objective, but is designed to satisfy
  a topological property that guarantees the avoidance of cycles and implies its convergence."
