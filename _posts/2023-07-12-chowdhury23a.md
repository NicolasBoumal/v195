title: Bregman Deviations of Generic Exponential Families
abstract: We revisit the method of mixtures, or Laplace method, to study the concentration
  phenomenon in generic (possibly multidimensional) exponential families. Using the
  duality properties of the Bregman divergence associated with the log-partition function
  of the family to construct nonnegative martingales, we establish a generic bound
  controlling the deviation between the parameter of the family and a finite sample
  estimate, expressed in the local geometry induced by the Bregman pseudo-metric.
  Our bound is time-uniform and involves a quantity extending the classical information
  gain to exponential families, which we call the Bregman information gain.For the
  practitioner, we instantiate this novel bound to several classical families, e.g.,
  Gaussian (including with unknown variance or multivariate), Bernoulli, Exponential,
  Weibull, Pareto, Poisson and Chi-square, yielding explicit forms of the confidence
  sets and the Bregman information gain. We further compare the resulting confidence
  bounds to state-of-the-art time-uniform alternatives and show this novel method
  yields competitive results. Finally, we apply our result to the design of generalized
  likelihood ratio tests for change detection, capturing new settings such as variance
  change in Gaussian families.
