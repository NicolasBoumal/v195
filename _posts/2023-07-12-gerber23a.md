title: Minimax optimal testing by classification
abstract: 'This paper considers an ML inspired approach to hypothesis testing known
  as classifier/classification-accuracy testing (CAT). In CAT, one first trains a
  classifier by feeding it labeled synthetic samples generated by the null and alternative
  distributions, which is then used to predict labels of the actual data samples.
  This method is widely used in practice when the null and alternative are only specified
  via simulators (as in many scientific experiments). We study goodness-of-fit, two-sample
  (TS) and likelihood-free hypothesis testing (LFHT), and show that CAT achieves (near-)minimax
  optimal sample complexity in both the dependence on the total-variation (TV) separation
  ε and the probability of error δ in a variety of non-parametric settings, including
  discrete distributions, d-dimensional distributions with a smooth density, and the
  Gaussian sequence model. In particular, we close the high probability sample complexity
  of LFHT for each class. As another highlight, we recover the minimax optimal complexity
  of TS over discrete distributions, which was recently established by Diakonikolas
  et al. (2021). The corresponding CAT simply compares empirical frequencies in the
  first half of the data, and rejects the null when the classification accuracy on
  the second half is better than random. '
