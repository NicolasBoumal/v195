title: PAC Verification of Statistical Algorithms
abstract: Goldwasser et al. (2021) recently proposed the setting of PAC verification,
  where a hypothesis (machine learning model) that purportedly satisfies the agnostic
  PAC learning objective is verified using an interactive proof. In this paper we
  develop this notion further in a number of ways. First, we prove a lower bound of
  $\Omega(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^2)$ i.i.d. samples for PAC verification of hypothesis
  classes of VC dimension $d$. Second, we present a protocol for PAC verification
  of unions of intervals over $\mathbb{R}$ that improves upon their proposed protocol
  for that task, and matches our lower boundâ€™s dependence on $d$. Third, we introduce
  a natural generalization of their definition to verification of general statistical
  algorithms, which is applicable to a wider variety of settings beyond agnostic PAC
  learning. Showcasing our proposed definition, our final result is a protocol for
  the verification of statistical query algorithms that satisfy a combinatorial constraint
  on their queries.
