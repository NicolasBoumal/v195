title: Linearization Algorithms for Fully Composite Optimization
abstract: This paper studies first-order algorithms for solving fully composite optimization
  problems over convex and compact sets. We leverage the structure of the objective
  by handling its differentiable and non-differentiable components separately, linearizing
  only the smooth parts. This provides us with new generalizations of the classical
  Frank-Wolfe method and the Conditional Gradient Sliding algorithm, that cater to
  a subclass of non-differentiable problems. Our algorithms rely on a stronger version
  of the linear minimization oracle, which can be efficiently implemented in several
  practical applications. We provide the basic version of our method with an affine-invariant
  analysis and prove global convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives.
  Furthermore, in the convex case, we propose an accelerated method with correspondingly
  improved complexity. Finally, we provide illustrative experiments to support our
  theoretical results.
