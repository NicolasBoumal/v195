title: 'On the Complexity of Multi-Agent Decision Making: From Learning in Games to
  Partial Monitoring'
abstract: A central problem in the theory of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
  is to understand what structural conditions and algorithmic principles lead to sample-efficient
  learning guarantees, and how these considerations change as we move from few to
  many agents. We study this question in a general framework for interactive decision
  making with multiple agents, encompassing Markov games with function approximation
  and normal-form games with bandit feedback. We focus on equilibrium computation,
  in which a centralized learning algorithm aims to compute an equilibrium by controlling
  multiple agents that interact with an (unknown) environment. Our main contributions
  are:• We provide upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity for multi-agent
  decision making based on a multi-agent generalization of the Decision-Estimation
  Coefficient, a complexity measure introduced by Foster et al. (2021) in the single-agent
  counterpart to our setting. Compared to the best results for the single-agent setting,
  our upper and lower bounds have additional gaps. We show that no “reasonable” complexity
  measure can close these gaps, highlighting a striking separation between single
  and multiple agents.• We show that characterizing the statistical complexity for
  multi-agent decision making is equivalent to characterizing the statistical complexity
  of single-agent decision making, but with hidden (unobserved) rewards, a framework
  that subsumes variants of the partial monitoring problem. As a consequence of this
  connection, we characterize the statistical complexity for hidden-reward interactive
  decision making to the best extent possible.Building on this development, we provide
  several new structural results, including 1) conditions under which the statistical
  complexity of multi-agent decision making can be reduced to that of single-agent,
  and 2) conditions under which the so-called curse of multiple agents can be avoided.
