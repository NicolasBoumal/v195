title: Fast, Sample-Efficient, Affine-Invariant Private Mean and Covariance Estimation
  for Subgaussian Distributions
abstract: We present a fast, differentially private algorithm for high-dimensional
  covariance-aware mean estimation with nearly optimal sample complexity. Only exponential-time
  estimators were previously known to achieve this guarantee. Given $n$ samples from
  a (sub-)Gaussian distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$, our
  $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private estimator produces $\tilde{\mu}$ such
  that $\|\mu - \tilde{\mu}\|_{\Sigma} \leq \alpha$ as long as $n \gtrsim \tfrac d
  {\alpha^2} + \tfrac{d \sqrt{\log 1/\delta}}{\alpha \epsilon}+\frac{d\log 1/\delta}{\epsilon}$.
  The Mahalanobis error metric $\|\mu - \hat{\mu}\|_{\Sigma}$ measures the distance
  between $\hat \mu$ and $\mu$ relative to $\Sigma$; it characterizes the error of
  the sample mean. Our algorithm runs in time $\tilde{O}(nd^{\omega - 1} + nd/\eps)$,
  where $\omega < 2.38$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.We adapt an exponential-time
  approach of Brown, Gaboardi, Smith, Ullman, and Zakynthinou (2021), giving efficient
  variants of stable mean and covariance estimation subroutines that also improve
  the sample complexity to the nearly optimal bound above.Our stable covariance estimator
  can be turned to private covariance estimation for unrestricted subgaussian distributions.
  With $n\gtrsim d^{3/2}$ samples, our estimate is accurate in spectral norm. This
  is the first such algorithm using $n= o(d^2)$ samples, answering an open question
  posed by Alabi et al. (2022). With $n\gtrsim d^2$ samples, our estimate is accurate
  in Frobenius norm. This leads to a fast, nearly optimal algorithm for private learning
  of unrestricted Gaussian distributions in TV distance.Duchi, Haque, and Kuditipudi
  (2023) obtained similar results independently and concurrently.
