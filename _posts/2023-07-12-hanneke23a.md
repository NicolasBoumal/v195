title: Universal Rates for Multiclass Learning
abstract: 'We study universal rates for multiclass classification, establishing the
  optimal rates (up to log factors) for all hypothesis classes. This generalizes previous
  results on binary classification (Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff,
  2021), and resolves an open question studied by Kalavasis, Velegkas, and Karbasi
  (2022) who handled the multiclass setting with a bounded number of class labels.
  In contrast, our result applies for any countable label space. Even for finite label
  space, our proofs provide a more precise bounds on the learning curves, as they
  do not depend on the number of labels. Specifically, we show that any class admits
  exponential rates if and only if it has no infinite Littlestone tree, and admits
  (near-)linear rates if and only if it has no infinite Daniely-Shalev-Shwartz-Littleston
  (DSL) tree, and otherwise requires arbitrarily slow rates. DSL trees are a new structure
  we define in this work, in which each node of the tree is given by a pseudo-cube
  of possible classifications of a given set of points. Pseudo-cubes are a structure,
  rooted in the work of Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014), and recently shown by Brukhim,
  Carmon, Dinur, Moran, and Yehudayoff (2022) to characterize PAC learnability (i.e.,
  uniform rates) for multiclass classification. We also resolve an open question of
  Kalavasis, Velegkas, and Karbasi (2022) regarding the equivalence of classes having
  infinite Graph-Littlestone (GL) trees versus infinite Natarajan-Littlestone (NL)
  trees, showing that they are indeed equivalent. '
