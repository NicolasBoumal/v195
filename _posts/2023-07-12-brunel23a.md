title: Geodesically convex $M$-estimation in metric spaces
abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of geodesically convex $M$-estimation
  on non-linear spaces. Namely, we prove that under very minimal assumptions besides
  geodesic convexity of the cost function, one can obtain consistency and asymptotic
  normality, which are fundamental properties in statistical inference. Our results
  extend the Euclidean theory of convex $M$-estimation; They also generalize limit
  theorems on non-linear spaces which, essentially, were only known for barycenters,
  allowing to consider robust alternatives that are defined through non-smooth $M$-estimation
  procedures.
