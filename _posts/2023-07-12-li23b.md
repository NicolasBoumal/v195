title: "$\\ell_p$-Regression in the Arbitrary Partition Model of Communication"
abstract: 'We consider the randomized communication complexity of the distributed
  $\ell_p$-regression problem in the coordinator model, for $p\in (0,2]$. In this
  problem, there is a coordinator and $s$ servers. The $i$-th server receives $A^i\in\{-M,
  -M+1, \ldots, M\}^{n\times d}$ and $b^i\in\{-M, -M+1, \ldots, M\}^n$ and the coordinator
  would like to find a $(1+\eps)$-approximate solution to $\min_{x\in\R^n} \norm{(\sum_i
  A^i)x - (\sum_i b^i)}_p$. Here $M \leq \poly(nd)$ for convenience. This model, where
  the data is additively shared across servers, is commonly referred to as the arbitrary
  partition model.     We obtain significantly improved bounds for this problem. For
  $p = 2$, i.e., least squares regression, we give the first optimal bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(sd^2
  + sd/\epsilon)$ bits.     For $p \in (1,2)$, we obtain an $\tilde{O}(sd^2/\eps +
  sd/\poly(\eps))$ upper bound. Notably, for $d$ sufficiently large, our leading order
  term only depends linearly on $1/\epsilon$ rather than quadratically. We also show
  communication lower bounds of $\Omega(sd^2 + sd/\eps^2)$ for $p\in (0,1]$ and $\Omega(sd^2
  + sd/\eps)$ for $p\in (1,2]$. Our bounds considerably improve previous bounds due
  to (Woodruff et al. COLT, 2013) and (Vempala et al., SODA, 2020). '
