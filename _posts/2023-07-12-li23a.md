title: Allocating Divisible Resources on Arms with Unknown and Random Rewards
abstract: We consider a decision maker allocating one unit of renewable and divisible
  resource in each period on a number of arms. The arms have unknown and random rewards
  whose means are proportional to the allocated resource and whose variances are proportional
  to an order $b$ of the allocated resource. When the order ranges from 0 to 1, the
  framework smoothly bridges the standard stochastic multi-armed bandit and online
  learning with full feedback. We design two algorithms that attain the optimal gap-dependent
  and gap-independent regret bounds for $b\in [0,1]$, and demonstrate a phase transition
  at $b=1/2$. The theoretical results hinge on a novel concentration inequality we
  have developed that bounds a linear combination of sub-Gaussian random variables
  whose weights are fractional, adapted to the filtration, and monotonic.
