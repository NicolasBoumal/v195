title: Online Reinforcement Learning in Stochastic Continuous-Time Systems
abstract: 'Linear dynamical systems that obey stochastic differential equations are
  canonical models. While optimal control of known systems has a rich literature,
  the problem is technically hard under model uncertainty and there are hardly any
  such result. We initiate study of this problem and aim to learn (and simultaneously
  deploy) optimal actions for minimizing a quadratic cost function. Indeed, this work
  is the first that comprehensively addresses the crucial challenge of balancing exploration
  versus exploitation in continuous-time systems. We present online policies that
  learn optimal actions fast by carefully randomizing the parameter estimates, and
  establish their performance guarantees: a regret bound that grows with square-root
  of time multiplied by the number of parameters. Implementation of the policy for
  a flight-control task demonstrates its efficacy. Further, we prove sharp stability
  results for inexact system dynamics and tightly specify the infinitesimal regret
  caused by sub-optimal actions. To obtain the results, we conduct a novel eigenvalue-sensitivity
  analysis for matrix perturbation, establish upper-bounds for comparative ratios
  of stochastic integrals, and introduce the new method of policy differentiation.
  Our analysis sheds light on fundamental challenges in continuous-time reinforcement
  learning and suggests a useful cornerstone for similar problems.'
