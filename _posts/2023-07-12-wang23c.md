title: On Classification-Calibration of Gamma-Phi Losses
abstract: Gamma-Phi losses constitute a family of multiclass classification loss functions
  that generalize the logistic and other common losses, and have found application
  in the boosting literature. We establish the first general sufficient condition
  for the classification-calibration (CC) of such losses. To our knowledge, this sufficient
  condition gives the first family of nonconvex multiclass surrogate losses for which
  CC has been fully justified. In addition, we show that a previously proposed sufficient
  condition is in fact not sufficient. This contribution highlights a technical issue
  that is important in the study of multiclass CC but has been neglected in priorwork.
