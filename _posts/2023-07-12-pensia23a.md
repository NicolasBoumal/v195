title: Simple Binary Hypothesis Testing under Local Differential Privacy and Communication
  Constraints
abstract: 'We study simple binary hypothesis testing under local differential privacy
  (LDP) and communication constraints. Our results are either minimax optimal or instance
  optimal: the former hold for the set of distribution pairs with prescribed Hellinger
  divergence and total variation distance, whereas the latter hold for specific distribution
  pairs. For the sample complexity of simple hypothesis testing under pure LDP constraints,
  we establish instance-optimal bounds for distributions with binary support; minimax-optimal
  bounds for general distributions; and (approximately) instance-optimal, computationally
  efficient algorithms for general distributions. Under both privacy and communication
  constraints, we develop instance-optimal, computationally efficient algorithms that
  achieve minimal sample complexity (up to universal constants). Our results on instance-optimal
  algorithms hinge on identifying the extreme points of the joint range set of two
  distributions $p$ and $q$, defined as $\mathcal{A} := \{(\mathbf{T} p, \mathbf{T}
  q) | \mathbf{T} \in \mathcal{C}\}$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of channels characterizing
  the constraints.'
