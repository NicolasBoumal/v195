title: Condition-number-independent Convergence Rate of Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte
  Carlo with Numerical Integrators
abstract: 'We study the convergence rate of discretized Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte
  Carlo on sampling from distributions in the form of $e^{-f(x)}$ on a convex body
  $\mathcal{M}\subset\R^{n}$. We show that for distributions in the form of $e^{-\alpha^{\top}x}$
  on a polytope with $m$ constraints, the convergence rate of a family of commonly-used
  integrators is independent of $\left\Vert \alpha\right\Vert _{2}$ and the geometry
  of the polytope. In particular, the implicit midpoint method (IMM) and the generalized
  Leapfrog method (LM) have a mixing time of $\widetilde{O}\left(mn^{3}\right)$ to
  achieve $\epsilon$ total variation distance to the target distribution. These guarantees
  are based on a general bound on the convergence rate for densities of the form $e^{-f(x)}$
  in terms of parameters of the manifold and the integrator. Our theoretical guarantee
  complements the empirical results of \cite{kook2022sampling}, which shows that RHMC
  with IMM can sample ill-conditioned, non-smooth and constrained distributions in
  very high dimension efficiently in practice. '
