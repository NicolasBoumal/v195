title: 'From high-dimensional & mean-field dynamics to dimensionless ODEs: A unifying
  approach to SGD in two-layers networks'
abstract: 'This manuscript investigates the one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
  dynamics of a two-layer neural network trained on Gaussian data and labels generated
  by a similar, though not necessarily identical, target function. We rigorously analyse
  the limiting dynamics via a deterministic and low-dimensional description in terms
  of the sufficient statistics for the population risk. Our unifying analysis bridges
  different regimes of interest, such as the classical gradient-flow regime of vanishing
  learning rate, the high-dimensional regime of large input dimension, and the overparameterised
  “mean-field” regime of large network width, covering as well the intermediate regimes
  where the limiting dynamics is determined by the interplay between these behaviours.
  In particular, in the high-dimensional limit, the infinite-width dynamics is found
  to remain close to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by the target principal directions.
  Our results therefore provide a unifying picture of the limiting SGD dynamics with
  synthetic data. '
