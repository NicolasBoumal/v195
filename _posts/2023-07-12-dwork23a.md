title: From Pseudorandomness to Multi-Group Fairness and Back
abstract: We identify and explore connections between the recent literature on multi-group
  fairness for prediction algorithms and the pseudorandomness notions of leakage-resilience
  and graph regularity. We frame our investigation using new, statistical distance-based
  variants of multicalibration that are closely related to the concept of outcome
  indistinguishability. Adopting this perspective leads us naturally not only to our
  graph theoretic results, but also to new, more efficient algorithms for multicalibration
  in certain parameter regimes and a novel proof of a hardcore lemma for real-valued
  functions.
