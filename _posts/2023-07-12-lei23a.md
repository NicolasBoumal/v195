title: Stability and Generalization of Stochastic Optimization with Nonconvex and
  Nonsmooth Problems
abstract: Stochastic optimization has found wide applications in minimizing objective
  functions in machine learning, which motivates a lot of theoretical studies to understand
  its practical success. Most of existing studies focus on the convergence of optimization
  errors, while the generalization analysis of stochastic optimization is much lagging
  behind. This is especially the case for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems often encountered
  in practice. In this paper, we initialize a systematic stability and generalization
  analysis of stochastic optimization on nonconvex and nonsmooth problems. We introduce
  novel algorithmic stability measures and establish their quantitative connection
  on the gap between population gradients and empirical gradients, which is then further
  extended to study the gap between the Moreau envelope of the empirical risk and
  that of the population risk. To our knowledge, these quantitative connection between
  stability and generalization in terms of either gradients or Moreau envelopes have
  not been studied in the literature. We introduce a class of sampling-determined
  algorithms, for which we develop bounds for three stability measures. Finally, we
  apply these results to derive error bounds for stochastic gradient descent and its
  adaptive variant, where we show how to achieve an implicit regularization by tuning
  the step sizes and the number of iterations.
