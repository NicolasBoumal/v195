title: A High-dimensional Convergence Theorem for U-statistics with Applications to
  Kernel-based Testing
abstract: We prove a convergence theorem for U-statistics of degree two, where the
  data dimension $d$ is allowed to scale with sample size $n$. We find that the limiting
  distribution of a U-statistic undergoes a phase transition from the non-degenerate
  Gaussian limit to the degenerate limit, regardless of its degeneracy and depending
  only on a moment ratio. A surprising consequence is that a non-degenerate U-statistic
  in high dimensions can have a non-Gaussian limit with a larger variance and asymmetric
  distribution. Our bounds are valid for any finite $n$ and $d$, independent of individual
  eigenvalues of the underlying function, and dimension-independent under a mild assumption.
  As an application, we apply our theory to two popular kernel-based distribution
  tests, MMD and KSD, whose high-dimensional performance has been challenging to study.
  In a simple empirical setting, our results correctly predict how the test power
  at a fixed threshold scales with $d$ and the bandwidth.
