title: Minimax Instrumental Variable Regression and $L_2$ Convergence Guarantees without
  Identification or Closedness
abstract: 'In this paper, we study nonparametric estimation of instrumental variable
  (IV) regressions. Recently, many flexible machine learning methods have been developed
  for instrumental variable estimation. However, these methods have at least one of
  the following limitations: (1) restricting the IV regression  to be uniquely identified;
  (2) only obtaining estimation error rates in terms weak metrics (e.g., projected
  norm) rather than strong metrics (e.g., L_2 norm); or (3) imposing the so-called
  closedness condition that requires a certain conditional expectation operator to
  be sufficiently smooth. In this paper, we present the first method and analysis
  that can avoid all three limitations, while still permitting general function approximation.
  Specifically, we propose a new penalized minimax estimator that can converge to
  a fixed IV  solution even when there are multiple solutions, and we derive a strong
  L_2 error rate for our estimator under lax conditions. Notably, this guarantee only
  needs a widely-used source condition and realizability assumptions, but not the
  so-called closedness condition. We argue that the source condition and the closedness
  condition are inherently conflicting, so relaxing the latter significantly improves
  upon the existing literature that requires both conditions. Our estimator can achieve
  this improvement because it builds on a novel formulation of the IV estimation problem
  as a constrained optimization problem.'
