title: A Pretty Fast Algorithm for Adaptive Private Mean Estimation
abstract: We design an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm to
  estimate the mean of a $d$-variate distribution, with unknown covariance $\Sigma$,
  that is adaptive to $\Sigma$. To within polylogarithmic factors, the estimator achieves
  optimal rates of convergence with respect to the induced Mahalanobis norm $||\cdot||_\Sigma$,
  takes time $\tilde{O}(n d^2)$ to compute, has near linear sample complexity for
  sub-Gaussian distributions, allows $\Sigma$ to be degenerate or low rank, and adaptively
  extends beyond sub-Gaussianity. Prior to this work, other methods required exponential
  computation time or the superlinear scaling $n = \Omega(d^{3/2})$ to achieve non-trivial
  error with respect to the norm $||\cdot||_\Sigma$.
