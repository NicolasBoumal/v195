title: Accelerated and Sparse Algorithms for Approximate Personalized PageRank and
  Beyond
abstract: "     It has recently been shown that ISTA, an unaccelerated optimization
  method, presents sparse updates for the $\\ell_1$-regularized undirected personalized
  PageRank problem (Fountoulakis et al., 2019), leading to cheap iteration complexity
  and providing the same guarantees as the approximate personalized PageRank algorithm
  (\\appr{}), (Andersen et al., 2016).      In this work, we design an accelerated
  optimization algorithm for this problem that also performs sparse updates, providing
  an affirmative answer to the COLT 2022 open question of (Fountoulakis et al., 2022).
  \ Acceleration provides a reduced dependence on the condition number, while the
  dependence on the sparsity in our updates differs from the ISTA approach.      Further,
  we design another algorithm by using conjugate directions to achieve an exact solution
  while exploiting sparsity. Both algorithms lead to faster convergence for certain
  parameter regimes. Our findings apply beyond PageRank and work for any quadratic
  objective whose Hessian is a positive-definite $M$-matrix."
