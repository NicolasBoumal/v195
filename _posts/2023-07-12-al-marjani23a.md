title: Active Coverage for PAC Reinforcement Learning
abstract: " Collecting and leveraging data with good coverage properties plays a crucial
  role in different aspects of reinforcement learning (RL), including reward-free
  exploration and offline learning.   However, the notion of “good coverage” really
  depends on the application at hand, as data suitable for one context may not be
  so for another.   In this paper, we formalize the problem of \\emph{active coverage}
  in episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the goal is to interact with
  the environment so as to fulfill given sampling requirements.   This framework is
  sufficiently flexible to specify any desired coverage property, making it applicable
  to any problem that involves online exploration.   Our main contribution is an \\emph{instance-dependent}
  lower bound on the sample complexity of active coverage and a simple game-theoretic
  algorithm, CovGame, that nearly matches it. We then show that CovGame can be used
  as a building block to solve different PAC RL tasks. In particular, we obtain a
  simple algorithm for PAC reward-free exploration with an instance-dependent sample
  complexity that, in certain MDPs which are “easy to explore”, is lower than the
  minimax one.   By further coupling this exploration algorithm with a new technique
  to do implicit eliminations in policy space, we obtain a computationally-efficient
  algorithm for best-policy identification whose instance-dependent sample complexity
  scales with gaps between policy values. "
