title: Reaching Kesten-Stigum Threshold in the Stochastic Block Model under Node Corruptions
abstract: We study robust community detection in the context of node-corrupted stochastic
  block model,  where an adversary can arbitrarily modify all the edges incident to
  a fraction of the n vertices. We present the first polynomial-time algorithm that
  achieves weak recovery at the Kesten-Stigum threshold even in the presence of a
  small constant fraction of corrupted nodes. Prior to this work, even state-of-the-art
  robust algorithms were known to break under such node corruption adversaries, when
  close to the Kesten-Stigum threshold.We further extend our techniques to the $Z_2$
  synchronization problem, where our algorithm reaches the optimal recovery threshold
  in the presence of similar strong adversarial perturbations.The key ingredient of
  our algorithm is a novel identifiability proof that leverages the push-out effect
  of the Grothendieck norm of principal submatrices.
