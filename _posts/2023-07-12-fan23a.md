title: Improved dimension dependence of a proximal algorithm for sampling
abstract: 'We propose a sampling algorithm that achieves superior complexity bounds
  in all the classical settings (strongly log-concave, log-concave, Logarithmic-Sobolev
  inequality (LSI), Poincar√© inequality) as well as more general settings with semi-smooth
  or composite potentials. Our algorithm is based on the proximal sampler introduced
  in Lee et al. 2021. The performance of this proximal sampler is determined by that
  of the restricted Gaussian oracle (RGO), a key step in the proximal sampler. The
  main contribution of this work is an inexact realization of RGO based on approximate
  rejection sampling. To bound the inexactness of RGO, we establish a new concentration
  inequality for semi-smooth functions over Gaussian distributions, extending the
  well-known concentration inequality for Lipschitz functions. Applying our RGO implementation
  to the proximal sampler, we achieve state-of-the-art complexity bounds in almost
  all settings. For instance, for strongly log-concave distributions, our method has
  complexity bound $\tilde\cO(\kappa d^{1/2})$ without warm start, better than the
  minimax bound for MALA. For distributions satisfying the LSI, our bound is $\tilde
  \cO(\hat \kappa d^{1/2})$ where $\hat \kappa$ is the ratio between smoothness and
  the LSI constant, better than all existing bounds. '
