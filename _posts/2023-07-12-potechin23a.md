title: Near-optimal fitting of ellipsoids to random points
abstract: 'Given independent standard Gaussian points $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ in dimension
  $d$, for what values of $(n, d)$ does there exist with high probability an origin-symmetric
  ellipsoid that simultaneously passes through all of the points? This basic problem
  of fitting an ellipsoid to random points has connections to low-rank matrix decompositions,
  independent component analysis, and principal component analysis. Based on strong
  numerical evidence, Saunderson, Parrilo, and Willsky [Proc. of Conference on Decision
  and Control, pp. 6031-6036, 2013] conjectured that the ellipsoid fitting problem
  transitions from feasible to infeasible as the number of points $n$ increases, with
  a sharp threshold at $n \sim d^2/4$. We resolve this conjecture up to logarithmic
  factors by constructing a fitting ellipsoid for some $n = d^2/\mathrm{polylog}(d)$.
  Our proof demonstrates feasibility of the least squares construction of Saunderson
  et al. using a convenient decomposition of a certain non-standard random matrix
  and a careful analysis of its Neumann expansion via the theory of graph matrices. '
