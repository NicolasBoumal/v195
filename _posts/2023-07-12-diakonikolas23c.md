title: Self-Directed Linear Classification
abstract: 'In online classification, a learner is presented with a sequence of examples
  and aims to predict their labels in an online fashion so as to minimize the total
  number of mistakes. In the self-directed variant, the learner knows in advance the
  pool of examples and can adaptively choose the order in which predictions are made.
  Here we study the power of choosing the prediction order and establish the first
  strong separation between worst-order and random-order learning for the fundamental
  task of linear classification. Prior to our work, such a separation was known only
  for very restricted concept classes, e.g., one-dimensional thresholds or axis-aligned
  rectangles.We present two main results.If $X$ is a dataset of $n$ points drawn uniformly
  at random from the $d$-dimensional unit sphere, we design an efficient self-directed
  learner thatmakes $O(d \log \log(n))$ mistakes and classifies the entire dataset.If
  $X$ is an arbitrary $d$-dimensional dataset of size $n$, we design an efficient
  self-directed learner that predicts the labels of $99%$ of the points in $X$ with
  mistake bound independent of $n$. In contrast, under a worst- or random-ordering,
  the number of mistakes must be at least $\Omega(d \log n)$, even when the points
  are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere and the learner only needs to predict the
  labels for $1%$ of them. '
