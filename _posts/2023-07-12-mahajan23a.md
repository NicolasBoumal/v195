title: Learning Hidden Markov Models Using Conditional Samples
abstract: 'This paper is concerned with the computational and statistical  complexity
  of learning the Hidden Markov model (HMM).  Although HMMs  are some of the most
  widely used tools in sequential and time series  modeling, they are cryptographically
  hard to learn in the standard  setting where one has access to i.i.d. samples of
  observation  sequences. In this paper, we depart from this setup and consider an  \emph{interactive
  access model}, in which the algorithm can query  for samples from the \emph{conditional
  distributions} of the  HMMs. We show that interactive access to the HMM enables  computationally
  efficient learning algorithms, thereby bypassing  cryptographic hardness.Specifically,
  we obtain efficient algorithms for learning HMMs in two settings: \begin{enumerate}
  \item An easier setting where we have query access to the exact conditional probabilities.
  Here our algorithm runs in polynomial time and makes polynomially many queries to
  approximate any HMM in total variation distance. \item A harder setting where we
  can only obtain samples from the  conditional distributions. Here the performance
  of the algorithm depends on a new parameter, called the fidelity of the HMM. We
  show that this captures cryptographically hard instances and all previously known
  positive results. \end{enumerate}  We also show that these results extend to a broader
  class of  distributions with latent low rank structure. Our algorithms can be viewed
  as generalizations and robustifications of Angluinâ€™s $L^*$ algorithm for learning
  deterministic finite automata from membership queries.'
