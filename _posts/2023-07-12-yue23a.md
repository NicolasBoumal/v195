title: On the Lower Bound of Minimizing Polyak-Łojasiewicz functions
abstract: Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) (Polyak, 1963) condition is a weaker condition than
  the strong convexity but suffices to ensure a global convergence for the Gradient
  Descent algorithm. In this paper, we study the lower bound of algorithms using first-order
  oracles to find an approximate optimal solution. We show that any first-order algorithm
  requires at least ${\Omega}\left(\frac{L}{\mu}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ gradient
  costs to με find an $\epsilon$-approximate optimal solution for a general $L$-smooth
  function that has an $\mu$-PL constant. This result demonstrates the optimality
  of the Gradient Descent algorithm to minimize smooth PL functions in the sense that
  there exists a “hard” PL function such that no first-order algorithm can be faster
  than Gradient Descent when ignoring a numerical constant. In contrast, it is well-known
  that the momentum technique, e.g. Nesterov (2003, chap. 2), can provably accelerate
  Gradient Descent to ${O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{L}{\hat{\mu}}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$
  gradient costs for functions that are $L$-smooth and $\hat{\mu}$-strongly convex.
  Therefore, our result distinguishes the hardness of minimizing a smooth PL function
  and a smooth strongly convex function as the complexity of the former cannot be
  improved by any polynomial order in general.
