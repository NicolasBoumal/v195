title: 'Beyond Parallel Pancakes: Quasi-Polynomial Time Guarantees for Non-Spherical
  Gaussian Mixtures'
abstract: We consider mixtures of k >= 2 Gaussian components with unknown means and
  unknown covariance (identical for all components) that are well-separated, i.e.,
  distinct components have statistical overlap at most k^{-C} for a large enough constant
  C >= 1.Previous statistical-query [DKS17] and cryptographic [BRST21, GVV22] lower
  bounds give formal evidence that, even for the special case of colinear means, distinguishing
  such mixtures from (pure) Gaussians may be exponentially hard (in k).We show that,
  surprisingly, this kind of hardness can only appear if mixing weights are allowed
  to be exponentially small. For polynomially lower bounded mixing weights, we show
  how to achieve non-trivial statistical guarantees in quasi-polynomial time.Concretely,
  we develop an algorithm based on the sum-of-squares method with running time quasi-polynomial
  in the minimum mixing weight. The algorithm can reliably distinguish between a mixture
  of k >= 2 well-separated Gaussian components and a (pure) Gaussian distribution.
  As a certificate, the algorithm computes a bipartition of the input sample that
  separates some pairs of mixture components, i.e., both sides of the bipartition
  contain most of the sample points of at least one component.For the special case
  of colinear means, our algorithm outputs a k-clustering of the input sample that
  is approximately consistent with all components of the underlying mixture. We obtain
  similar clustering guarantees also for the case that the overlap between any two
  mixture components is lower bounded quasi-polynomially ink (in addition to being
  upper bounded polynomially in k).A significant challenge for our results is that
  they appear to be inherently sensitive to small fractions of adversarial outliers
  unlike most previous algorithmic results for Gaussian mixtures. The reason is that
  such outliers can simulate exponentially small mixing weights even for mixtures
  with polynomially lower bounded mixing weights.A key technical ingredient of our
  algorithms is a characterization of separating directions for well-separated Gaussian
  components in terms of ratios of polynomials that correspond to moments of two carefully
  chosen orders logarithmic in the minimum mixing weight.
