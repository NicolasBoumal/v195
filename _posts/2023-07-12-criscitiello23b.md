title: 'Open Problem: Polynomial linearly-convergent method for g-convex optimization?'
abstract: Let $f \colon \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a Lipschitz and geodesically
  convex function defined on a $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$.
  Does there exist a first-order deterministic algorithm which (a) uses at most $O(\mathrm{poly}(d)
  \log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ subgradient queries to find a point with target accuracy $\epsilon$,
  and (b) requires only $O(\mathrm{poly}(d))$ arithmetic operations per query? In
  convex optimization, the classical ellipsoid method achieves this. After detailing
  related work, we provide an ellipsoid-like algorithm with query complexity $O(d^2
  \log^2(\epsilon^{-1}))$ and per-query complexity $O(d^2)$ for the limited case where
  $\mathcal{M}$ has constant curvature (hemisphere or hyperbolic space). We then detail
  possible approaches and corresponding obstacles for designing an ellipsoid-like
  method for general Riemannian manifolds.
