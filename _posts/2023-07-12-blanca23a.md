title: Complexity of High-Dimensional Identity Testing with Coordinate Conditional
  Sampling
abstract: 'We study the identity testing problem for high-dimensional distributions.
  Given as input an explicit distribution $\mu$, an $\varepsilon>0$, and access to
  sampling oracle(s) for a hidden distribution $\pi$, the goal in identity testing
  is to distinguish whether the two distributions $\mu$ and $\pi$ are identical or
  are at least $\varepsilon$-far apart. When there is only access to full samples
  from the hidden distribution $\pi$, it is known that exponentially many samples
  (in the dimension) may be needed for identity testing, and hence previous works
  have studied identity testing with additional access to various “conditional” sampling
  oracles. We consider a significantly weaker conditional sampling oracle, which we
  call the Coordinate Oracle, and provide a computational and statistical characterization
  of the identity testing problem in this new model.We prove that if an analytic property
  known as approximate tensorization of entropy holds for an $n$-dimensional visible
  distribution $\mu$, then there is an efficient identity testing algorithm for any
  hidden distribution $\pi$ using $\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ queries to the Coordinate
  Oracle. Approximate tensorization of entropy is a pertinent condition as recent
  works have established it for a large class of high-dimensional distributions. We
  also prove a computational phase transition: for a well-studied class of $n$-dimensional
  distributions, specifically sparse antiferromagnetic Ising models over $\{+1,-1\}^n$,
  we show that in the regime where approximate tensorization of entropy fails, there
  is no efficient identity testing algorithm unless RP=NP. We complement our results
  with a matching $\Omega(n/\varepsilon)$ statistical lower bound for the sample complexity
  of identity testing in the $\coorora$ model.'
