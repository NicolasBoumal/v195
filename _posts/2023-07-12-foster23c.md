title: 'Contextual Bandits with Packing and Covering Constraints: A Modular Lagrangian
  Approach via Regression'
abstract: We consider contextual bandits with linear constraints (CBwLC), a variant
  of contextual bandits in which the algorithm consumes multiple resources subject
  to linear constraints on total consumption. This problem generalizes contextual
  bandits with knapsacks (CBwK), allowing for packing and covering constraints, as
  well as positive and negative resource consumption. We provide the first algorithm
  for CBwLC (or CBwK) that is based on regression oracles. The algorithm is simple,
  computationally efficient, and admits vanishing regret. It is statistically optimal
  for the variant of CBwK in which the algorithm must stop once some constraint is
  violated. Further, we provide the first vanishing-regret guarantees for CBwLC (or
  CBwK) that extend beyond the stochastic environment. We side-step strong impossibility
  results from prior work by identifying a weaker (and, arguably, fairer) benchmark
  to compare against. Our algorithm builds on LagrangeBwK (Immorlica et al., FOCS
  2019), a Lagrangian-based technique for CBwK, and SquareCB (Foster and Rakhlin,
  ICML 2020), a regression-based technique for contextual bandits. Our analysis leverages
  the inherent modularity of both techniques.
