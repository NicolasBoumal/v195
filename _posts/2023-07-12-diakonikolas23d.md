title: Statistical and Computational Limits for Tensor-on-Tensor Association Detection
abstract: In this paper, we consider the tensor-on-tensor association detection problem,
  where the goal is to detect whether there is an association between the tensor responses
  to tensor covariates linked via a low-rank tensor parameter. We first In this paper,
  we consider the tensor-on-tensor association detection problem, where the goal is
  to detect whether there is an association between the tensor responses to tensor
  covariates linked via a low-rank tensor parameter. We first develop tight bounds
  on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) such that the detection problem is statistically
  possible. We then provide testing procedures that succeed when the SNR is above
  the threshold. On the other hand, the statistical optimal tests often require computing
  the largest singular value of a given tensor, which can be NP-hard in general. To
  complement that, we develop efficient polynomial-time testing procedures with provable
  guarantees. We also develop matching lower bounds under the Statistical Query model
  and show that the SNRs required by the proposed polynomial-time algorithms are essential
  for computational efficiency. We identify a gap that appears between the SNR requirements
  of the optimal unconstrained-time tests and polynomial-time tests if and only if
  the sum of the tensor response order and the tensor covariate order is no less than
  three. To our best knowledge, this is the first complete characterization of the
  statistical and computational limits for the general tensor-on-tensor association
  detection problem. Our findings significantly generalize the results in the literature
  on signal detection in linear regression and low-rank matrix trace regression. Finally,
  the connection on the computational hardness of the detection problem and the corresponding
  estimation problem is discussed.
