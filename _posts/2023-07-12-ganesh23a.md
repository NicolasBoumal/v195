title: Universality of Langevin Diffusion for Private Optimization, with Applications
  to Sampling from Rashomon Sets
abstract: 'In this paper we provide an algorithmic framework based on Langevin diffusion
  (LD) and its corresponding discretizations that allow us to simultaneously obtain:
  i) An algorithm for sampling from the exponential mechanism, whose privacy analysis
  does not depend on convexity, and which can be stopped at anytime without compromising
  privacy, and ii) tight uniform stability guarantees for the exponential mechanism.
  As a direct consequence, we obtain optimal excess empirical and population risk
  guarantees for (strongly) convex losses under both pure and approximate differential
  privacy (DP). The framework allows us to design a DP uniform sampler from a  Rashomon
  set. Rashomon sets are widely used in interpretable and robust machine learning,
  understanding variable importance, and characterizing fairness.'
