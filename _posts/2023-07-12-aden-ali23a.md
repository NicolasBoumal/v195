title: The One-Inclusion Graph Algorithm is not Always Optimal
abstract: 'The one-inclusion graph algorithm of Haussler, Littlestone, and Warmuth
  achieves an optimal in-expectation risk bound in the standard PAC classification
  setup. In one of the first COLT open problems, Warmuth conjectured that this prediction
  strategy always implies an optimal high probability bound on the risk, and hence
  is also an optimal PAC algorithm. We refute this conjecture in the strongest sense:
  for any practically interesting Vapnik-Chervonenkis class, we provide an in-expectation
  optimal one-inclusion graph algorithm whose high probability risk bound cannot go
  beyond that implied by Markovâ€™s inequality. Our construction of these poorly performing
  one-inclusion graph algorithms uses Varshamov-Tenengolts error correcting codes.
  Our negative result has several implications. First, it shows that the same poor
  high-probability performance is inherited by several recent prediction strategies
  based on generalizations of the one-inclusion graph algorithm. Second, our analysis
  shows yet another statistical problem that enjoys an estimator that is provably
  optimal in expectation via a leave-one-out argument, but fails in the high-probability
  regime. This discrepancy occurs despite the boundedness of the binary loss for which
  arguments based on concentration inequalities often provide sharp high probability
  risk bounds.'
