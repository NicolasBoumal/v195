title: 'Breaking the Curse of Multiagency: Provably Efficient Decentralized Multi-Agent
  RL with Function Approximation'
abstract: A unique challenge in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is the \emph{curse
  of multiagency}, where the description length of the game as well as the complexity
  of many existing learning algorithms scale \emph{exponentially} in the number of
  agents. While recent work successfully addresses this challenge under the model
  of tabular Markov Games, their mechanisms critically rely on the number of states
  being finite and small, and do not extend to practical scenarios with enormous state
  spaces where \emph{function approximation} must be used to approximate value functions
  or policies. This paper presents the first line of MARL algorithms that provably
  resolve the curse of multiagency under function approximation. We design a new algorithm—\emph{V-Learning
  with Policy Replay}, which gives the first \emph{polynomial} sample complexity results
  for learning approximate Coarse Correlated Equilibria (CCEs) of Markov Games under
  decentralized linear function approximation. Our algorithm always outputs Markov
  CCEs, and its sample complexity also significantly improves over the current best
  result for finding Markov CCEs in the tabular setting. This paper further presents
  an alternative algorithm—\emph{Decentralized Optimistic Policy Mirror Descent},
  which finds policy-class-restricted CCEs using a polynomial number of samples. In
  exchange for learning a weaker version of CCEs, this algorithm applies to a wider
  range of problems under generic function approximation, such as linear quadratic
  games and MARL problems with low “marginal” Eluder dimension.
