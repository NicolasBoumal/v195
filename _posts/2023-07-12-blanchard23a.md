title: 'Quadratic Memory is Necessary for Optimal Query Complexity in Convex Optimization:
  Center-of-Mass is Pareto-Optimal'
abstract: 'We give query complexity lower bounds for convex optimization and the related
  feasibility problem. We show that quadratic memory is necessary to achieve the optimal
  oracle complexity for first-order convex optimization. In particular, this shows
  that center-of-mass cutting-planes algorithms in dimension $d$ which use $\tilde
  O(d^2)$ memory and $\tilde O(d)$ queries are Pareto-optimal for both convex optimization
  and the feasibility problem, up to logarithmic factors. Precisely, we prove that
  to minimize $1$-Lipschitz convex functions over the unit ball to $1/d^4$ accuracy,
  any deterministic first-order algorithms using at most $d^{2-\delta}$ bits of memory
  must make $\tilde\Omega(d^{1+\delta/3})$ queries, for any $\delta\in[0,1]$. For
  the feasibility problem, in which an algorithm only has access to a separation oracle,
  we show a stronger trade-off: for at most $d^{2-\delta}$ memory, the number of queries
  required is $\tilde\Omega(d^{1+\delta})$. This resolves a COLT 2019 open problem
  of Woodworth and Srebro.'
