title: Bagging is an Optimal PAC Learner
abstract: 'Determining the optimal sample complexity of PAC learning in the realizable
  setting was a central open problem in learning theory for decades. Finally, the
  seminal work by Hanneke (2016) gave an algorithm with a provably optimal sample
  complexity. His algorithm is based on a careful and structured sub-sampling of the
  training data and then returning a majority vote among hypotheses trained on each
  of the sub-samples. While being a very exciting theoretical result, it has not had
  much impact in practice, in part due to inefficiency, since it constructs a polynomial
  number of sub-samples of the training data, each of linear size.In this work, we
  prove the surprising result that the practical and classic heuristic \emph{bagging}
  (a.k.a. bootstrap aggregation), due to Breiman (1996), is in fact also an optimal
  PAC learner. Bagging pre-dates Hannekeâ€™s algorithm by twenty years and is taught
  in most undergraduate machine learning courses. Moreover, we show that it only requires
  a logarithmic number of sub-samples to reach optimality. '
