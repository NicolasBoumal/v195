title: 'Orthogonal Directions Constrained Gradient Method: from non-linear equality
  constraints to Stiefel manifold'
abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a non-convex function over a smooth
  manifold M. We propose a novel algorithm, the Orthogonal Directions Constrained
  Gradient Method (ODCGM), which only requires computing a projection onto a vector
  space. ODCGM is infeasible but the iterates are constantly pulled towards the manifold,
  ensuring the convergence of ODCGM towards M. ODCGM is much simpler to implement
  than the classical methods which require the computation of a retraction. Moreover,
  we show that ODCGM exhibits the near-optimal oracle complexities O(1/ε^{-2}) and
  O(1/ε^{-4}) in the deterministic and stochastic cases, respectively. Furthermore,
  we establish that, under an appropriate choice of the projection metric, our method
  recovers the landing algorithm of Ablin and Peyré (2022), a recently introduced
  algorithm for optimization over the Stiefel manifold. As a result, we significantly
  extend the analysis of Ablin and Peyré (2022), establishingnear-optimal rates both
  in deterministic and stochastic frameworks. Finally, we perform numerical experiments,
  which shows the efficiency of ODCGM in a high-dimensional setting.
