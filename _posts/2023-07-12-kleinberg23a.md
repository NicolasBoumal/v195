title: 'U-Calibration: Forecasting for an Unknown Agent'
abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating forecasts of binary events whose predictions
  are consumed by rational agents who take an action in response to a prediction,
  but whose utility is unknown to the forecaster. We show that optimizing forecasts
  for a single scoring rule (e.g., the Brier score) cannot guarantee low regret for
  all possible agents. In contrast, forecasts that are well-calibrated guarantee that
  all agents incur sublinear regret. However, calibration is not a necessary criterion
  here (it is possible for miscalibrated forecasts to provide good regret guarantees
  for all possible agents), and calibrated forecasting procedures have provably worse
  convergence rates than forecasting procedures targeting a single scoring rule.Motivated
  by this, we present a new metric for evaluating forecasts that we call U-calibration,
  equal to the maximal regret of the sequence of forecasts when evaluated under any
  bounded scoring rule. We show that sublinear U-calibration error is a necessary
  and sufficient condition for all agents to achieve sublinear regret guarantees.
  We additionally demonstrate how to compute the U-calibration error efficiently and
  provide an online algorithm that achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$  U-calibration error (on
  par with optimal rates for optimizing for a single scoring rule, and bypassing lower
  bounds for the traditionally calibrated learning procedures). Finally, we discuss
  generalizations to the multiclass prediction setting.
