title: Tighter PAC-Bayes Bounds Through Coin-Betting
abstract: 'We consider the problem of estimating the mean of a sequence of random
  elements $f(\theta, X_1)$ $, \ldots, $ $f(\theta, X_n)$ where $f$ is a fixed scalar
  function, $S=(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ are independent random variables, and $\theta$
  is a possibly $S$-dependent parameter. An example of such a problem would be to
  estimate the generalization error of a neural network trained on $n$ examples where
  $f$ is a loss function. Classically, this problem is approached through concentration
  inequalities holding uniformly over compact parameter sets of functions $f$, for
  example as in Rademacher or VC type analysis. However, in many problems, such inequalities
  often yield numerically vacuous estimates. Recently, the \emph{PAC-Bayes} framework
  has been proposed as a better alternative for this class of problems for its ability
  to often give numerically non-vacuous bounds. In this paper, we show that we can
  do even better: we show how to refine the proof strategy of the PAC-Bayes bounds
  and achieve \emph{even tighter} guarantees. Our approach is based on the \emph{coin-betting}
  framework that derives the numerically tightest known time-uniform concentration
  inequalities from the regret guarantees of online gambling algorithms. In particular,
  we derive the first PAC-Bayes concentration inequality based on the coin-betting
  approach that holds simultaneously for all sample sizes.  We demonstrate its tightness
  showing that by \emph{relaxing} it we obtain a number of previous results in a closed
  form including Bernoulli-KL and empirical Bernstein inequalities. Finally, we propose
  an efficient algorithm to numerically calculate confidence sequences from our bound,
  which often generates nonvacuous confidence bounds even with one sample, unlike
  the state-of-the-art PAC-Bayes bounds.'
