title: Differentially Private and Lazy Online Convex Optimization
abstract: 'We study the task of differentially private online convex optimization
  (OCO). In the online setting, the release of each distinct decision or iterate carries
  with it the potential for privacy loss. To limit such privacy leakage, we design
  an optimization-based OCO algorithm that explicitly limits the number of switches
  via objective perturbation and rejection sampling. This improves over known results
  in multiple aspects: an optimal leading-order regret term, in being efficiently
  implementable without requiring log-concave sampling subroutines, and in matching
  the non-private regret bound for sub-constant regimes of privacy parameters. Leveraging
  the fact that the algorithm is designed to explicitly minimize the number of switches
  of decisions, we show that the algorithm also obtains optimal regret bounds in the
  lazy OCO setting, where the learner is constrained to perform a limited number of
  switches. In addition, for one- and two-dimensional decision sets, we present a
  novel approach for differentially private online Lipschitz learning, where the loss
  functions are Lipschitz but not necessarily convex, that achieves the optimal regret
  bound matching known lower bounds.'
