title: Algorithmic Aspects of the Log-Laplace Transform and a Non-Euclidean Proximal
  Sampler
abstract: The development of efficient sampling algorithms catering to non-Euclidean
  geometries has been a challenging endeavor, as discretization techniques which succeed
  in the Euclidean setting do not readily carry over to more general settings. We
  develop a non-Euclidean analog of the recent proximal sampler of [LST21], which
  naturally induces regularization by an object known as the log-Laplace transform
  (LLT) of a density. We prove new mathematical properties (with an algorithmic flavor)
  of the LLT, such as strong convexity-smoothness duality and an isoperimetric inequality,
  which are used to prove a mixing time on our proximal sampler matching [LST21] under
  a warm start. As our main application, we show our warm-started sampler improves
  the value oracle complexity of differentially private convex optimization in $\ell_p$
  and Schatten-$p$ norms for $p \in [1, 2]$ to match the Euclidean setting [GLL22],
  while retaining state-of-the-art excess risk bounds [GLLST23]. We find our investigation
  of the LLT to be a promising proof-of-concept of its utility as a tool for designing
  samplers, and outline directions for future exploration.
