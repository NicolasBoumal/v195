title: Ticketed Learning–Unlearning Schemes
abstract: We consider the learning–unlearning paradigm defined as follows. First given
  a dataset, the goal is to learn a good predictor, such as one minimizing a certain
  loss. Subsequently, given any subset of examples that wish to be unlearnt, the goal
  is to learn, without the knowledge of the original training dataset, a good predictor
  that is identical to the predictor that would have been produced when learning from
  scratch on the surviving examples.We propose a new ticketed model for learning–unlearning
  wherein the learning algorithm can send back additional information in the form
  of a small-sized (encrypted) “ticket” to each participating training example, in
  addition to retaining a small amount of “central” information for later. Subsequently,
  the examples that wish to be unlearnt present their tickets to the unlearning algorithm,
  which additionally uses the central information to return a new predictor. We provide
  space-efficient ticketed learning–unlearning schemes for a broad family of concept
  classes, including thresholds, parities, intersection-closed classes, among others.En
  route, we introduce the count-to-zero problem, where during unlearning, the goal
  is to simply know if there are any examples that survived. We give a ticketed learning–unlearning
  scheme for this problem that relies on the construction of Sperner families with
  certain properties, which might be of independent interest.
