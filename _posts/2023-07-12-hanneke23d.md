title: Bandit Learnability can be Undecidable
abstract: 'We initiate a general investigation into structured bandits. Specifically,
  for an abstract space $X$, we suppose a true reward function $f$ resides in a known,
  but arbitrary, function class $F$. The algorithm may then pull a number of arms
  $x$ (i.e., query for the value $f(x)$), and thereby attempts to identify an arm
  $\hat{x}$ of near-maximum reward: $f(\hat{x}) \geq \sup_x f(x) - \epsilon$. While
  special cases of this problem are well understood in the literature, our interest
  is in the possibility of a fully-general theory of bandit learnability, analogous
  to the PAC model for classification: that is, a theory which precisely characterizes
  which function classes $F$ admit a learning algorithm guaranteed to identify a near-optimal
  arm within a bounded number of pulls.Our main result in this regard is an illuminating
  impossibility result. Namely, there exist well-defined function classes $F$ such
  that bandit learnability is \emph{undecidable} within ZFC set theory. While such
  undecidability results have previously been shown for a certain abstractly-defined
  learning problem known as EMX, this is the first example of a natural or commonly-encountered
  learning problem (i.e., bandits) for which learnability can be provably undecidable.
  Our proof is based on establishing a (rather-sophisticated) equivalence between
  certain subfamilies of EMX learning problems and corresponding constructed bandit
  problems.Despite this general undecidability result, we also establish new general
  results in special cases. Specifically, we characterize the optimal query complexity
  in the special case of binary-valued reward functions in terms of a combinatorial
  complexity measure related to the teaching dimension.  We also present an extension
  to general bounded real-valued rewards, though in this case the upper bound is not
  always optimal.  We instantiate the new complexity measures for several important
  families of function classes $F$.'
