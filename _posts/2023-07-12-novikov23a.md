title: Sparse PCA Beyond Covariance Thresholding
abstract: In the Wishart model for sparse PCAwe are given $n$ samples $Y_1,\ldots,  Y_n$
  drawn independently from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution $N({0, Id + \beta
  vv^\top})$, where $\beta > 0$ and $v\in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $k$-sparse unit vector,
  and we wish to recover $v$ (up to sign).We show that if $n \ge \Omega(d)$, then
  for every $t \ll k$ there exists an algorithm running in time $n\cdot d^{O(t)}$
  that solves this problem as long as\[\beta \gtrsim \frac{k}{\sqrt{nt}}\sqrt{\ln({2
  + td/k^2})}\,.\]Prior to this work, the best polynomial time algorithm in the regime
  $k\approx \sqrt{d}$, called \emph{Covariance Thresholding} (proposed in  Krauthgamer
  et al. (2015) and analyzed in Deshpande and Montanari (2014))), required $\beta
  \gtrsim \frac{k}{\sqrt{n}}\sqrt{\ln({2 + d/k^2})}$.For large enough constant $t$
  our algorithm runs in polynomial time and has better guarantees than Covariance
  Thresholding.Previously known algorithms with such guarantees required quasi-polynomial
  time $d^{O(\log d)}$.Our idea is based on the idea of Alon et al. (1998) for reducing
  the clique size in the planted clique problem.Moreover, we show that it is possible
  to combine our techniques with recent results on sparse PCA with symmetric heavy-tailed
  noise d’Orsi et al. (2022).Their model generalizes both sparse PCA and the planted
  clique problem.In particular, in the regime $k \approx \sqrt{d}$ we get the first
  polynomial time algorithm that works with symmetric heavy-tailed noise, while the
  algorithm from  d’Orsi et al. (2022) requires quasi-polynomial time in these settings.
  As a consequence, we get an algorithm that solves a problem that captures both sparse
  PCA and planted clique and achieves best known guarantees for both of them.In addition,
  we show that our techniques work with sparse PCA with adversarial perturbations
  studied in d’Orsi et al. (2020).This model generalizes not only sparse PCA, but
  also the sparse planted vector problem.As a consequence, we provide polynomial time
  algorithms for the sparse planted vector problem that have better guarantees thanthe
  state of the art in some regimes.
