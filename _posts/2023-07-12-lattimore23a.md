title: A Second-Order Method for Stochastic Bandit Convex Optimisation
abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient algorithm for unconstrained zeroth-order
  stochastic convex bandits and prove its regret is at most (1 + r/d)[d^1.5 sqrt(n)
  + d^3] polylog(n, d, r) where n is the horizon, d the dimension and r is the radius
  of a known ball containing the minimiser of the loss.
