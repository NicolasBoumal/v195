title: Oracle-Efficient Smoothed Online Learning for Piecewise Continuous Decision
  Making
abstract: Smoothed online learning has emerged as a popular framework to  mitigate
  the substantial loss in statistical and computational complexity that arises when
  one moves from classical to adversarial learning.  Unfortunately, for some spaces,
  it has been shown that efficient algorithms suffer an exponentially worse regret
  than that which is minimax optimal, even when the learner has access to an optimization
  oracle over the space.  To mitigate that exponential dependence, this work introduces
  a new notion of complexity, the generalized bracketing numbers, which marries constraints
  on the adversary to the size of the space, and shows that an instantiation of Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader
  can attain low regret with the number of calls to the optimization oracle scaling
  optimally with respect to average regret.  We then instantiate our bounds in several
  problems of interest, including online prediction and planning of piecewise continuous
  functions, which has many applications in fields as diverse as econometrics and
  robotics.
