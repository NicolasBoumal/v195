title: Geometric Barriers for Stable and Online Algorithms for Discrepancy Minimization
abstract: 'For many computational problems involving randomness, intricate geometric
  features of the solution space have been used to rigorously rule out powerful classes
  of algorithms. This is often accomplished through the lens of the multi Overlap
  Gap Property ($m$-OGP), a rigorous barrier against algorithms exhibiting input stability.
  In this paper, we focus on the algorithmic tractability of two models: (i) discrepancy
  minimization, and (ii) the symmetric binary perceptron (\texttt{SBP}), a random
  constraint satisfaction problem as well as a toy model of a single-layer neural
  network.Our first focus is on the limits of online algorithms. By establishing and
  leveraging a novel geometrical barrier, we obtain sharp hardness guarantees against
  online algorithms for both the \texttt{SBP} and discrepancy minimization. Our results
  match the best known  algorithmic guarantees, up to constant factors. Our second
  focus is on efficiently finding a constant discrepancy solution, given a random
  matrix $\mathcal{M}\in\R^{M\times n}$. In a smooth setting, where the entries of
  $\mathcal{M}$ are i.i.d.\,standard normal, we establish the presence of $m$-OGP
  for $n=\Theta(M\log M)$. Consequently, we rule out the class of stable algorithms
  at this value. These results give the first rigorous evidence towards \citet[Conjecture 1]{altschuler2021discrepancy}.  Our
  methods use the intricate geometry of the solution space to prove tight hardness
  results for online algorithms. The barrier we establish is a novel variant of the
  $m$-OGP.  Furthermore, it regards $m$-tuples of solutions with respect to correlated
  instances, with growing values of $m$, $m=\omega(1)$.  Importantly, our results
  rule out online algorithms succeeding even with an exponentially small probability.'
