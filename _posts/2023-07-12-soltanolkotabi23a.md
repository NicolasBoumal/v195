title: 'Implicit Balancing and Regularization: Generalization and Convergence Guarantees
  for Overparameterized Asymmetric Matrix Sensing'
abstract: 'Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding the convergence
  and generalization properties of gradient-based methods for training overparameterized
  learning models. However, many aspects including the role of small random initialization
  and how the various parameters of the model are coupled during gradient-based updates
  to facilitate good generalization, remain largely mysterious. A series of recent
  papers have begun to study this role for non-convex formulations of symmetric Positive
  Semi-Definite (PSD) matrix sensing problems which involve reconstructing a low-rank
  PSD matrix from a few linear measurements. The underlying symmetry/PSDness is crucial
  to existing convergence and generalization guarantees for this problem. In this
  paper, we study a general overparameterized low-rank matrix sensing problem where
  one wishes to reconstruct an asymmetric rectangular low-rank matrix from a few linear
  measurements. We prove that an overparameterized model trained via factorized gradient
  descent converges to the low-rank matrix generating the measurements. We show that
  in this setting, factorized gradient descent enjoys two implicit properties: (1)
  coupling of the trajectory of gradient descent where the factors are coupled in
  various ways throughout the gradient update trajectory and (2) an algorithmic regularization
  property where the iterates show a propensity towards low-rank models despite the
  overparameterized nature of the factorized model. These two implicit properties
  in turn allow us to show that the gradient descent trajectory from small random
  initialization moves towards solutions that are both globally optimal and generalize
  well.'
