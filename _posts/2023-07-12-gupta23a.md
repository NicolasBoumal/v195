title: Finite-Sample Symmetric Mean Estimation with Fisher Information Rate
abstract: 'The mean of an unknown variance-$\sigma^2$ distribution $f$ can be estimated
  from $n$ samples with variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ and nearly corresponding subgaussian
  rate.  When $f$ is known up to translation, this can be improved asymptotically
  to $\frac{1}{nI}$, where $I$ is the Fisher information of the distribution.  Such
  an improvement is not possible for general unknown $f$, but [Stone 1975] showed
  that this asymptotic convergence \emph{is} possible if $f$ is _symmetric_ about
  its mean.  Stoneâ€™s bound is asymptotic, however: the $n$ required for convergence
  depends in an unspecified way on the distribution $f$ and failure probability $\delta$.   In
  this paper we give finite-sample guarantees for symmetric mean estimation in terms
  of Fisher information.  For every $f, n, \delta$ with $n > \log \frac{1}{\delta}$,
  we get convergence close to a subgaussian with variance $\frac{1}{n I_r}$, where
  $I_r$ is the $r$-smoothed Fisher information with smoothing radius $r$ that decays
  polynomially in $n$.  Such a bound essentially matches the finite-sample guarantees
  in the known-$f$ setting.'
