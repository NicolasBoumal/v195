title: Best-of-three-worlds Analysis for Linear Bandits with Follow-the-regularized-leader
  Algorithm
abstract: 'The linear bandit problem has been studied for many years in both stochastic
  and adversarial settings. Designing an algorithm that can optimize the environment
  without knowing the loss type attracts lots of interest. \citet{LeeLWZ021} propose
  an algorithm that actively detects the loss type and then switches between different
  algorithms specially designed for specific settings. However, such an approach requires
  meticulous designs to perform well in all environments. Follow-the-regularized-leader
  (FTRL) is another type of popular algorithm that can adapt to different environments.
  This algorithm is of simple design and the regret bounds are shown to be optimal
  in traditional multi-armed bandit problems compared with the detect-switch type.
  Designing an FTRL-type algorithm for linear bandits is an important question that
  has been open for a long time. In this paper, we prove that the FTRL algorithm with
  a negative entropy regularizer can achieve the best-of-three-world results for the
  linear bandit problem. Our regret bounds achieve the same or nearly the same order
  as the previous detect-switch type algorithm but with a much simpler algorithmic
  design. '
