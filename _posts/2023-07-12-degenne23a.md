title: On the Existence of a Complexity in Fixed Budget Bandit Identification
abstract: 'In fixed budget bandit identification, an algorithm sequentially observes
  samples from several distributions up to a given final time.It then answers a query
  about the set of distributions. A good algorithm will have a small probability of
  error.While that probability decreases exponentially with the final time, the best
  attainable rate is not known precisely for most identification tasks.We show that
  if a fixed budget task admits a complexity, defined as a lower bound on the probability
  of error which is attained by the same algorithm on all bandit problems, then that
  complexity is determined by the best non-adaptive sampling procedure for that problem.We
  show that there is no such complexity for several fixed budget identification tasks
  including Bernoulli best arm identification with two arms: there is no single algorithm
  that attains everywhere the best possible rate.'
