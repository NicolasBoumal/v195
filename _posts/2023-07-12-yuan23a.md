title: On a Class of Gibbs Sampling over Networks
abstract: 'We consider the sampling problem from a composite distribution whose potential
  (negative log density) is $\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x_i)+\sum_{j=1}^m g_j(y_j)+\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m\nicefrac{\sigma_{ij}}{2\eta}
  \Vert x_i-y_j \Vert^2_2$ where each of $x_i$ and $y_j$ is in $\Rd$, $f_1, f_2, \ldots,
  f_n, g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_m$ are strongly convex functions, and $\{\sigma_{ij}\}$
  encodes a network structure. Building on the Gibbs sampling method, we develop an
  efficient sampling framework for this problem when the network is a bipartite graph.
  More importantly, we establish a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate for it.
  This work extends earlier works that involve only a graph with two nodes \cite{lee2021structured}.
  To the best of our knowledge, our result represents the first non-asymptotic analysis
  of a Gibbs sampler for structured log-concave distributions over networks.Our framework
  can be potentially used to sample from the distribution $ \propto \exp[-\sum_{i=1}^n
  f_i(x)-\sum_{j=1}^m g_j(x)]$ in a distributed manner. '
