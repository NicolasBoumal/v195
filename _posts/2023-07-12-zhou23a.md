title: A new ranking scheme for modern data and its application to two-sample hypothesis
  testing
abstract: 'Rank-based approaches are among the most popular nonparametric methods
  for univariate data in tackling statistical problems such as hypothesis testing
  due to their robustness and effectiveness. However, they are unsatisfactory for
  more complex data. In the era of big data, high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data,
  such as networks and images, are ubiquitous and pose challenges for statistical
  analysis. Existing multivariate ranks such as component-wise, spatial, and depth-based
  ranks do not apply to non-Euclidean data and have limited performance for high-dimensional
  data. Instead of dealing with the ranks of observations, we propose two types of
  ranks applicable to complex data based on a similarity graph constructed on observations:
  a graph-induced rank defined by the inductive nature of the graph and an overall
  rank defined by the weight of edges in the graph. To illustrate their utilization,
  both the new ranks are used to construct test statistics for the two-sample hypothesis
  testing, which converge to the $\chi_2^2$ distribution under the permutation null
  distribution and some mild conditions of the ranks, enabling an easy type-I error
  control. Simulation studies show that the new method exhibits good power under a
  wide range of alternatives compared to existing methods. The new test is illustrated
  on the New York City taxi data for comparing travel patterns in consecutive months
  and a brain network dataset comparing male and female subjects.'
