title: Precise Asymptotic Analysis of Deep Random Feature Models
abstract: 'We provide exact asymptotic expressions for the performance of regression
  by an $L-$layer deep random feature (RF) model, where the input is mapped through
  multiple random embedding and non-linear activation functions. For this purpose,
  we establish two key steps: First, we prove a novel universality result for RF models
  and deterministic data, by which we demonstrate that a deep random feature model
  is equivalent to a deep linear Gaussian model that matches it in the first and second
  moments, at each layer. Second, we make use of the convex Gaussian Min-Max theorem
  multiple times to obtain the exact behavior of deep RF models.  We further characterize
  the variation of the eigendistribution in different layers of the equivalent Gaussian
  model, demonstrating that depth has a tangible effect on model performance despite
  the fact that only the last layer of the model is being trained. '
