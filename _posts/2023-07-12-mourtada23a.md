title: Local Risk Bounds for Statistical Aggregation
abstract: In the problem of aggregation, the aim is to combine a given class of base
  predictors to achieve predictions nearly as accurate as the best one. In this flexible
  framework, no assumption is made on the structure of the class or the nature of
  the target. Aggregation has been studied in both sequential and statistical contexts.
  Despite some important differences between the two problems, the classical results
  in both cases feature the same global complexity measure. In this paper, we revisit
  and tighten classical results in the theory of aggregation in the statistical setting
  by replacing the global complexity with a smaller, local one. Some of our proofs
  build on the PAC-Bayes localization technique introduced by Catoni. Among other
  results, we prove localized versions of the classical bound for the exponential
  weights estimator due to Leung and Barron and deviation-optimal bounds for the Q-aggregation
  estimator. These bounds improve over the results of Dai, Rigollet and Zhang for
  fixed design regression and the results of Lecué and Rigollet for random design
  regression.
