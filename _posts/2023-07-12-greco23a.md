title: 'Non-asymptotic convergence bounds for Sinkhorn iterates and their gradients:
  a coupling approach.'
abstract: Computational optimal transport (OT) has recently emerged as a powerful
  framework with applications in various fields. In this paper we focus on a relaxation
  of the original OT problem, the entropic OT problem, which allows to implement efficient
  and practical algorithmic solutions, even in high dimensional settings. This formulation,
  also known as the Schr√∂dinger Bridge problem, notably connects with Stochastic Optimal
  Control (SOC) and can be solved with the popular Sinkhorn algorithm. In the case
  of discrete-state spaces, this algorithm is known to have exponential convergence;
  however, achieving a similar rate of convergence in a more general setting is still
  an active area of research. In this work, we analyze the convergence of the Sinkhorn
  algorithm for probability measures defined on the d-dimensional torus T, that admit
  densities with respect to the Haar measure of T. In particular, we prove pointwise
  exponential convergence of Sinkhorn iterates and their gradient. Our proof relies
  on the connection between these iterates and the evolution along the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
  equations of value functions obtained from SOC-problems. Our approach is novel in
  that it is purely probabilistic and relies on coupling by reflection techniques
  for controlled diffusions on the torus.
