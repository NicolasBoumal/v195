title: The Sample Complexity of Approximate Rejection Sampling With Applications to
  Smoothed Online Learning
abstract: Suppose we are given access to $n$ independent samples from distribution
  $\mu$ and we wish to output one of them with the goal of making the outputdistributed
  as close as possible to a target distribution $\nu$.  In this workwe show that the
  optimal total variation distance as a function of $n$ is givenby $\tilde\Theta(\frac{D}{fâ€™(n)})$
  over the class of all pairs $\nu,\mu$ with a bounded $f$-divergence $D_f(\nu\|\mu)\leq
  D$. Previously, this question was studied only for the case when the Radon-Nikodym
  derivative of $\nu$ with respect to $\mu$ is uniformly bounded. We then consider
  an application in theseemingly very different field of smoothed online learning,
  where we show that recent results on the minimax regret and the regret of oracle-efficient
  algorithmsstill hold even under relaxed constraints on the adversary (to have bounded
  $f$-divergence, as opposed to bounded Radon-Nikodym derivative).  Finally, we also
  study efficacy of importance sampling for mean estimates uniformover a function
  class and compare importance sampling with rejectionsampling.
