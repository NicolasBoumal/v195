title: Efficient Algorithms for Sparse Moment Problems without Separation
abstract: We consider the sparse moment problem of learning a $k$-spike mixture in
  high-dimensional space from its noisy moment information in any dimension. We measure
  the accuracy of the learned mixtures using transportation distance. Previous algorithms
  either assume certain separation assumptions, use more recovery moments, or run
  in (super) exponential time. Our algorithm for the 1-dimensional problem (also called
  the sparse Hausdorff moment problem) is a robust version of the classic Prony’s
  method, and our contribution mainly lies in the analysis. We adopt a global and
  much tighter analysis than previous work (which analyzes the perturbation of the
  intermediate results of Prony’s method). A useful technical ingredient is a connection
  between the linear system defined by the Vandermonde matrix and the Schur polynomial,
  which allows us to provide tight perturbation bound independent of the separation
  and may be useful in other contexts. To tackle the high-dimensional problem, we
  first solve the 2-dimensional problem by extending the 1-dimensional algorithm and
  analysis to complex numbers. Our algorithm for the high-dimensional case determines
  the coordinates of each spike by aligning a 1d projection of the mixture to a random
  vector and a set of 2d projections of the mixture. Our results have applications
  to learning topic models and Gaussian mixtures, implying improved sample complexity
  results or running time over prior work.
