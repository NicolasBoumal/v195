title: 'Curvature and complexity: Better lower bounds for geodesically convex optimization'
abstract: We study the query complexity of geodesically convex (g-convex) optimization
  on a manifold.  To isolate the effect of that manifoldâ€™s curvature, we primarily
  focus on hyperbolic spaces.  In a variety of settings (smooth or not; strongly g-convex
  or not; high- or low-dimensional), known upper bounds worsen with curvature.  It
  is natural to ask whether this is warranted, or an artifact.For many such settings,
  we propose a first set of lower bounds which indeed confirm that (negative) curvature
  is detrimental to complexity.  To do so, we build on recent lower bounds (Hamilton
  and Moitra, 2021; Criscitiello and Boumal, 2022) for the particular case of smooth,
  strongly g-convex optimization.  Using a number of techniques, we also secure lower
  bounds which capture dependence on condition number and optimality gap, which was
  not previously the case.We suspect these bounds are not optimal.  We conjecture
  optimal ones, and support them with a matching lower bound for a class of algorithms
  which includes subgradient descent, and a lower bound for a related game.  Lastly,
  to pinpoint the difficulty of proving lower bounds, we study how negative curvature
  influences (and sometimes obstructs) interpolation with g-convex functions.
