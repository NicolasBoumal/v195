title: Is Planted Coloring Easier than Planted Clique?
abstract: 'We study the computational complexity of two related problems: recovering
  a planted q-coloring in G(n,1/2), and finding efficiently verifiable witnesses of
  non-q-colorability (a.k.a. refutations) in G(n,1/2). Our main results show hardness
  for both these problems in a restricted-but-powerful class of algorithms based on
  computing low-degree polynomials in the inputs.The problem of recovering a planted
  q-coloring is equivalent to recovering q disjoint planted cliques that cover all
  the vertices â€” a potentially easier variant of the well-studied planted clique problem.
  Our first result shows that this variant is as hard as the original planted clique
  problem in the low-degree polynomial model of computation: each clique needs to
  have size k >> sqrt(n) for efficient recovery to be possible. For the related variant
  where the cliques cover a (1-epsilon)-fraction of the vertices, we also show hardness
  by reduction from planted clique.Our second result shows that refuting q-colorability
  of G(n,1/2) is hard in the low-degree polynomial model when q >> n^{2/3} but easy
  when q << n^{1/2}, and we leave closing this gap for future work. Our proof is more
  subtle than similar results for planted clique and involves constructing a non-standard
  distribution over q-colorable graphs. We note that while related to several prior
  works, this is the first work that explicitly formulates refutation problems in
  the low-degree polynomial model.The proofs of our main results involve showing low-degree
  hardness of hypothesis testing between an appropriately constructed pair of distributions.
  For refutation, we show completeness of this approach: in the low-degree model,
  the refutation task is precisely as hard as the hardest associated testing problem,
  i.e., proving hardness of refutation amounts to finding a "hard" distribution.'
