title: Moments, Random Walks, and Limits for Spectrum Approximation
abstract: We study lower bounds for the problem of approximating a one dimensional
  distribution given (noisy) measurements of its moments. We show that there are distributions
  on $[-1,1]$ that cannot be approximated to accuracy $\epsilon$ in Wasserstein-1
  distance even if we know \emph{all} of their moments to multiplicative accuracy
  $(1\pm2^{-\Omega(1/\epsilon)})$; this result matches an upper bound of Kong and
  Valiant [Annals of Statistics, 2017].  To obtain our result, we provide a hard instance
  involving distributions induced by the eigenvalue spectra of carefully constructed
  graph adjacency matrices. Efficiently approximating such spectra in Wasserstein-1
  distance is a well-studied algorithmic problem, and a recent result of Cohen-Steiner
  et al. [KDD 2018] gives a method based on accurately approximating spectral moments
  using $2^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ random walks initiated at uniformly random nodes in the
  graph.As a strengthening of our main result, we show that improving the dependence
  on $1/\epsilon$ in this result would require a new algorithmic approach. Specifically,
  no algorithm can compute an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation to the spectrum of
  a normalized graph adjacency matrix with constant probability, even when given the
  transcript of $2^{\Omega(1/\epsilon)}$ random walks of length $2^{\Omega(1/\epsilon)}$
  started at random nodes.
