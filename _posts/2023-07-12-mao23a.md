title: Detection-Recovery Gap for Planted Dense Cycles
abstract: Planted dense cycles are a type of latent structure that appears in many
  applications, such as small-world networks in social sciences and sequence assembly
  in computational biology. We consider a model where a dense cycle with expected
  bandwidth $n \tau$ and edge density $p$ is planted in an Erdős–Rényi graph $G(n,q)$.
  We characterize the computational thresholds for the associated detection and recovery
  problems for the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms. In particular, a gap
  exists between the two thresholds in a certain regime of parameters. For example,
  if $n^{-3/4} \ll \tau \ll n^{-1/2}$ and $p = C q = \Theta(1)$ for a constant $C>1$,
  the detection problem is computationally easy while the recovery problem is hard
  for low-degree algorithms.
