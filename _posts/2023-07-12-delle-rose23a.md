title: 'Find a witness or shatter: the landscape of computable PAC learning.'
abstract: "   This paper contributes to the study of CPAC learnability —a computable
  version of PAC learning– by solving three open questions from recent papers. Firstly,
  we prove that every improperly CPAC learnable class is contained in a class which
  is properly CPAC learnable with polynomial sample complexity. This confirms a conjecture
  by Agarwal et al (COLT 2021). Secondly, we show that there exists a decidable class
  of hypotheses which is properly CPAC learnable, but only with uncomputably fast-growing
  sample complexity. This solves a question from Sterkenburg (COLT 2022). Finally,
  we construct a decidable class of finite Littlestone dimension which is not improperly
  CPAC learnable, strengthening a recent result of Sterkenburg (2022) and answering
  a question posed by Hasrati and Ben-David (ALT 2023). Together with previous work,
  our results provide a complete landscape for the learnability problem in the CPAC
  setting. "
