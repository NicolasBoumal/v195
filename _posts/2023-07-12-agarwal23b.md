title: Provable Benefits of Representational Transfer in Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We study the problem of representational transfer in RL, where an agent
  first pretrains in a number of \emph{source tasks} to discover a shared representation,
  which is subsequently used to learn a good policy in a \emph{target task}. We propose
  a new notion of task relatedness between source and target tasks, and develop a
  novel approach for representational transfer under this assumption. Concretely,
  we show that given a generative access to source tasks, we can discover a representation,
  using which subsequent linear RL techniques quickly converge to a near-optimal policy
  in the target task. The sample complexity is close to knowing the ground truth features
  in the target task, and comparable to prior representation learning results in the
  source tasks. We complement our positive results with lower bounds without generative
  access, and validate our findings with empirical evaluation on rich observation
  MDPs that require deep exploration. In our experiments, we observe speed up in learning
  in the target by pre-training, and also validate the need for generative access
  in source tasks.
