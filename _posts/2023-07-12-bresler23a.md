title: Detection-Recovery and Detection-Refutation Gaps via Reductions from Planted
  Clique
abstract: 'Planted Dense Subgraph (PDS) problem is a prototypical problem with a computational-statistical
  gap. It also exhibits an intriguing additional phenomenon: different tasks, such
  as detection or recovery, appear to have different computational limits. A detection-recovery
  gap for PDS was substantiated in the form of a precise conjecture given by Chen
  and Xu (2014) (based on the parameter values for which a convexified MLE succeeds),
  and then shown to hold for low-degree polynomial algorithms by Schramm and Wein
  (2022) and for MCMC algorithms for Ben Arous et al. (2020). In this paper we demonstrate
  that a slight variation of the Planted Clique Hypothesis with secret leakage (introduced
  in Brennan and Bresler (2020)), implies a detection-recovery gap for PDS. In the
  same vein, we also obtain a sharp lower bound for refutation, yielding a detection-refutation
  gap. Our methods build on the framework of Brennan and Bresler (2020) to construct
  average-case reductions mapping secret leakage Planted Clique to appropriate target
  problems. '
