title: 'SGD learning on neural networks: leap complexity and saddle-to-saddle dynamics'
abstract: "   We investigate the time complexity of SGD learning on fully-connected
  neural networks with isotropic data. We put forward a complexity measure,{\\it the
  leap}, which measures how “hierarchical” target functions are. For $d$-dimensional
  uniform Boolean or isotropic Gaussian data, our main conjecture states that the
  time complexity to learn a function $f$ with low-dimensional support is $$\\Tilde
  \\Theta (d^{\\max(\\mathrm{Leap}(f),2)}) \\,\\,.$$    We prove a version of this
  conjecture for a class of functions on Gaussian isotropic data and 2-layer neural
  networks, under additional technical assumptions on how SGD is run. We show that
  the training  sequentially learns the function support with a saddle-to-saddle dynamic.
  Our result departs from Abbe et al.’22 by going beyond leap 1 (merged-staircase
  functions), and by going beyond the mean-field and gradient flow approximations
  that prohibit the full complexity control obtained here.Finally, we note that this
  gives an SGD complexity for the full training trajectory that matches that of Correlational
  Statistical Query (CSQ) lower-bounds. "
