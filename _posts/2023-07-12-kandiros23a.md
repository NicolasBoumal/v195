title: Learning and Testing Latent-Tree Ising Models Efficiently
abstract: We provide time- and sample-efficient algorithms for learning and testing
  latent-tree Ising models, i.e.Â Ising models that may only be observed at their leaf
  nodes. On the learning side, we obtain efficient algorithms for learning a tree-structured
  Ising model whose leaf node distribution is close in Total Variation Distance, improving
  on the results of \cite{cryan2001evolutionary}. On the testing side, we provide
  an efficient algorithm with fewer samples for testing whether two latent-tree Ising
  models have leaf-node distributions that are close or far in Total Variation distance.
  We obtain our algorithms by showing novel localization results for the total variation
  distance between the leaf-node distributions of tree-structured Ising models, in
  terms of their marginals on pairs of leaves.
