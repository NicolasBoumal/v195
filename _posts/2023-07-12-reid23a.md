title: The $k$-Cap Process on Geometric Random Graphs
abstract: 'The $k$-cap (or $k$-winners-take-all) process on a graph works as follows:
  in each iteration, a subset of $k$ vertices of the graph are identified as winners;
  the next round winners are the vertices that have the highest total degree from
  the current winners, with ties broken randomly. This natural process is a simple
  model of firing activity and inhibition in the brain and has been found to have
  desirable robustness properties as an activation function. We study its convergence
  on directed geometric random graphs in any constant dimension, revealing rather
  surprising behavior, with the support of the current active set converging to lie
  in a small ball and the active set itself remaining essentially random within that.  '
