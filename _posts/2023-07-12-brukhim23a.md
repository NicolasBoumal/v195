title: Improper Multiclass Boosting
abstract: We study the setting of multiclass boosting with a possibly large number
  of classes. A recent work by Brukhim, Hazan, Moran, and Schapire, 2021, proved a
  hardness result for a large class of natural boosting algorithms we call proper.
  These algorithms output predictors that correspond to a plurality-vote aggregation
  of weak hypotheses. In particular, they showed that proper boosting algorithms must
  incur a large cost that scales with the number of classes.In this work we propose
  an efficient improper multiclass boosting algorithm that circumvents this hardness
  result. A key component of our algorithm is based on the technique of list learning.
  In list learning, instead of predicting a single outcome for a given unseen input,
  the goal is to provide a short menu of predictions. The resulting boosting algorithm
  has sample and oracle complexity bounds that are entirely independent of the number
  of classes.A corollary of the above is that plurality-vote over a learnable class
  is also learnable. We complement this result by showing that other simple aggregations
  over hypotheses from a learnable class do not preserve learnability, unlike in the
  binary setting.
