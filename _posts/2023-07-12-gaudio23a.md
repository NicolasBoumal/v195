title: 'Community Detection in the Hypergraph SBM: Optimal Recovery Given the Similarity
  Matrix'
abstract: " Community detection is a fundamental problem in network science. In this
  paper, we consider community detection in hypergraphs drawn from the \\emph{hypergraph
  stochastic block model} (HSBM), with a focus on exact community recovery. We study
  the performance of polynomial-time algorithms which operate on the \\emph{similarity
  matrix} $W$, where $W_{ij}$ reports the number of hyperedges containing both $i$
  and $j$. Under this information model, Kim, Bandeira, and Goemans determined the
  information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery in the logarithmic degree regime,
  and proposed a semidefinite programming relaxation which they conjectured to be
  optimal. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture. We also design a simple and
  highly efficient spectral algorithm with nearly linear runtime and show that it
  achieves the information-theoretic threshold. Moreover, the spectral algorithm also
  succeeds in denser regimes and is considerably more efficient than previous approaches,
  establishing it as the method of choice. Our analysis of the spectral algorithm
  crucially relies on strong \\emph{entrywise} bounds on the eigenvectors of $W$.
  Our bounds are inspired by the work of Abbe, Fan, Wang, and Zhong, who developed
  entrywise bounds for eigenvectors of symmetric matrices with independent entries.
  Despite the complex dependency structure in similarity matrices, we prove similar
  entrywise guarantees."
