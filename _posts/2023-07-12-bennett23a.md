title: Inference on Strongly Identified Functionals of Weakly Identified Functions
abstract: In a variety of applications, including nonparametric instrumental variable
  (NPIV) analysis, proximal causal inference under unmeasured confounding, and missing-not-at-random
  data with shadow variables, we are interested in inference on a continuous linear
  functional (e.g., average causal effects) of nuisance function (e.g., NPIV regression)
  defined by conditional moment restrictions. These nuisance functions are generally
  weakly identified, in that the conditional moment restrictions can be severely ill-posed
  as well as admit multiple solutions. This is sometimes resolved by imposing strong
  conditions that imply the function can be estimated at rates that make inference
  on the functional possible. In this paper, we study a novel condition for the functional
  to be strongly identified even when the nuisance function is not; that is, the functional
  is amenable to asymptotically-normal estimation at root-n-rates. The condition implies
  the existence of debiasing nuisance functions, and we propose penalized minimax
  estimators for both the primary and debiasing nuisance functions. The proposed nuisance
  estimators can accommodate flexible function classes, and importantly they can converge
  to fixed limits determined by the penalization regardless of the identifiability
  of the nuisances. We use the penalized nuisance estimators to form a debiased estimator
  for the functional of interest and prove its asymptotic normality under generic
  high-level conditions, which provide for asymptotically valid confidence intervals.
  We also illustrate our method in a novel partially linear proximal causal inference
  problem and a partially linear instrumental variable regression problem.
